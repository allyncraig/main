# The Role of Women in the Church - Long Version

[Projects Page](index.md)

## Is it not a Sin?

So, let's take a *Sola Scriptura* look at the issue of the Role of Women in the Church.

Too many times, when people discuss the topic, they make arguments that do not come from the Bible.

Instead, let's see if we can, from a purely scriptural perspective, make any conclusions on this topic, especially as it relates to the texts in 1 Corinthians 14:34,35 and 1 Timothy 2:11,12.

At first glance, there are two main problems with these verse:

1. **Are they really that important?** Do they affect our salvation? Will we lose out on eternity if we don't follow these instructions?
2. **What do they really mean?** How do we get from "women must be silent and not permitted to speak" to "women must not be pastors and elders" (or any other practical application of Paul's instructions)?

Let's take a look at both of these questions.

## How Important are 1 Cor 14:34,35 and 1 Tim 2:11,12

What is it that can cause us to loose eternity? And do these verses fit that criteria?

Let's review some fundamentals: "*For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.*" (Rom 6:23).

If sin will cause us to lose out on eternity, then what is sin? "*... sin is the breaking of the law.*" (1Jn 3:4).

That's a pretty easy definition to understand: if we break the law, we are sinning (1Jn 3:4), and sin will result in eternal death (Rom 6:23).

So, logically, if 1Co 14:34,35 and 1Ti 2:11,12 are "the law", then we could reasonably conclude that not obeying these instructions would be sin, and therefore could be grounds for losing our salvation.

In that case, can we find evidence that these verses amount to "the law"? The answer is, yes. Notice in 1Co 14 verse 34 where it says: "*just as the law also says.*"

In fact, if we look at the bigger context of these verses, we would find even stronger language to this effect. Let's look at not just verses 34,35 but verses 33 through 38 (with emphasis):

> 33 *For God is not a God of confusion but of peace, **as in all the churches of the saints**.* 34 *Let the women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, **just as the Law also says**.* 35 *If they want to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.* 36 *Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?* 37 *If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that **the things I am writing to you are a commandment of the Lord**.* 38 *But **if anyone ignores this, he is to be ignored**.* (1 Cor 14:33-38)

Let's also expand 1 Tim 2:11,12 to include verse 13 (with emphasis):

> *11 A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. 12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet, 13 **because Adam was created first, then Eve**.* (1 Tim 2:11-13)

Notice the additional details that the full context brings:

- This is for all the churches of the saints, not just the local Corinthian church (verse 33);
- This is the law, and therefore a matter of salvation (verse 34);
- This is the law, ***AND*** a commandment from God (verse 37);
- Those who ignore this commandment should be ignored, or kicked out of the church (verse 38);
- This law/commandment was established when “Adam was created first,” and thus has been in effect since before sin (1 Tim 2:13).

In other words, this law/commandment that was established at creation applies to all churches and non-compliance is grounds for disfellowship. Sounds pretty important.

In fact, reasoning from scripture: (a) if we break this one law, we break the whole law (James 2:10); (b) sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4), and the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23); so therefore, (c) doesn't the Bible itself tell us that this matter is such a big deal that our salvation is affected?

What part of this conclusion is not scriptural? What part of this conclusion has relied on ***any*** evidence that is not in the Bible? What verses in the Bible can anyone point to that would disagree with this conclusion?

Be careful with this last question. Some might try to argue that Galations 3:28 (... *there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus*.) would contradict this conclusion. 

But isn't putting Gal 3:28 with 1 Cor 14:34,35 akin to matching Genesis 4:8 "*And Cain rose up and slew his brother Abel*" with Luke 10:27 "*Jesus said, 'Go, thou, and do likewise'*"? There are three specific reasons why Gen 4:8 doesn't go with Luk 10:27:

1. They're two different topics;
2. putting them together creates a contradiction; and
3. the contradiction goes against a commandment (Exo 20:13).

Putting Gal 3:28 with 1 Cor 14:34,35 is wrong ***for the same 3 reasons***.

1. They're two different topics. Gal 3:28 is about the universality of the Gospel (SDA fundamental belief #7): Jesus died for everyone and everyone can come to Jesus for salvation; while the context of 1 Cor 14 is spiritual gifts (SDA fundamental belief #17).
2. Putting these two texts together creates a contradiction: how could Paul allow something in one place (Gal 3:28), then disallow it in another (1 Cor 14:34,35)?
3. As we have already seen, 1 Cor 14:37 shows that these instructions are a Commandment. So not only is there a contradiction, but the contradiction goes against a commandment.

You will find when searching the scriptures that there are no texts in the Bible that contradict 1 Cor 14:33-38 being a commandment of God. It is an absolute requirement.

In that case, instead of ignoring these verses, shouldn't we try to understand them to ensure that we are following God's law?

That brings us to the second question:

## What do these verses really mean?

The verses don't explicitly say "women cannot be pastors or elders," so how can we allow the Bible to interpret itself and help us understand what this law/commandment is really all about?

Just as above, where I looked at the larger context, so now let's expand the context even further. Let's review all of 1 Corinthians chapter 14. What is the whole chapter about? Verse 1 gives us a clue: "... *earnestly desire spiritual gifts* ..." The entire chapter is about Spiritual Gifts (mostly Speaking in Tongues and Prophesying). In fact, if you looked carefully, you would find that chapters 12 and 13 are also about spiritual gifts. But I digress...

All of chapter 14 is instructions relating to Spiritual Gifts and their proper use in the church. Therefore, shouldn't we interpret verses 33-38 in that context? Isn't Paul telling us that there is a law/commandment relating to restrictions on spiritual gift roles that women may hold in the church? Since the entire chapter is about Spiritual Gifts, couldn't we reasonably conclude that ***any*** interpretation of verses 33-38 that is not about Spiritual Gifts must, necessarily, be wrong?

Think about all the different explanations that you have heard relating to these verses - all those explanations that come from outside the Bible. If they're not about Spiritual Gifts, and they don't take into account that Paul's instructions are a universally-applicable commandment of God, then they're wrong because they fail the *Sola Scriptura* test!

In that light, let's look at these verses to see if there are any clues to how we should interpret them as they relate to Spiritual Gifts?

There are two clues, actually: one is that they are a restriction on "speaking" (1 Cor 14:34) and the other is that they are a restriction on women having authority (1 Tim 2:12).

Regarding restrictions on "speaking", it's worth nothing that the Greek word used in these verses is not the word used for normal conversational speech, but rather the word is almost always used in the New Testament in the context of "public speaking" (e.g. Mat 12:46) or "preaching" (Mat 26:13, Mar 2:2, Mar 14:9, Acts 8:25, etc.). Since Paul is giving instructions for proper use of Spiritual Gifts in the church, what is the type of public speaking that one does in church, if not "preaching"? It is reasonable to conclude, therefore, that the only reasonable understanding of "speaking" here is that Paul was referring to "preaching" in church.

So, a simple understanding, derived entirely from the context of scripture, with no reference at all to non-scriptural sources would be that these instructions are a restriction on women holding Spiritual Gift roles relating to Preaching and Holding Authority.

We don't know exactly what specific roles the early Christian church applied these rules to, but the modern roles of pastor and elder are spiritual gifts (see Ephesians 4:11 and Romans 12:8) relating to preaching and having authority in the church. So Paul forbidding these roles to women would fit the historical practice of allowing only men to be pastors and elders. And this is the ***only*** practice that fits in the context.

Show me ***any*** other practice that fits all of the Biblical requirements.

## Is it Not a Sin?

Therefore, since the pastor and elder spiritual gift roles are the ones that relate to preaching and having authority, and since this restriction is a universally-applicable law/commandment in place since before sin entered the world, is it not correct to conclude that it is a sin for women to be pastors and elders?

## But... Why?

Why should this be a law and a matter of salvation? Why should we pay attention to this ritual that seems to push women down?

Consider for a moment some other strange rituals that we diligently observe in the Adventist Church: the Sabbath, Baptism, Communion and Tithing. These are all important elements of our faith, but they are also a bit strange and inconvenient. They seem so, until you look at them in the context that they are symbols of different aspects of our relationship with Jesus.

Could it be that the male-only headship in the church is also a symbol of yet another aspect of our relationship with Jesus Christ? Isn’t the Bible full of symbols where God portrays himself as the man, husband, pastor or shepherd and his people as the woman, wife, congregation or flock? “For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.” Ephesians 5:23.

Consider the entire book of Hosea, Isaiah 54:5, Ezekiel chapters 16 and 23, all of Jeremiah, Ephesians 5:22,23, Revelation 19:7-9, 21:2,9-11, 2 Corinthians 11:2. This reference to God as the man/husband and his people as the woman/wife is extensive.

Every Sabbath we inconvenience ourselves to cease our normal activities and rest to symbolically recognize Jesus as our creator. We inconvenience ourselves when we pay tithe, but this act symbolically recognizes God as the owner of everything. Similarly, when we inconvenience ourselves to appoint only men as pastors and elders, we symbolically recognize Jesus as the head of the church. Instead of looking at this ritual as pushing women down, we should look at it as lifting Jesus up as the rightful head of the church and portraying women as the beautiful and pure bride of Christ.

Consider also, that since women symbolize the people, appointing a woman as pastor or elder would be portraying the people as leading the church and is the equivalent to saying that we, the church, don’t need Jesus, and we can save ourselves. Wouldn't that be spiritual treason?

Could this be why it is so important for us, as a church, to keep this commandment and not allow women to fill the Spiritual Gift roles of pastor and elder?

## Such a Small Matter

It may seem like it’s a small matter to allow women to fill all roles in the church, but remember that the Bible is filled with stories showing that even small matters can make a big difference:

* It was a small matter for Cain to bring an offering as God required it, but his disobedience had severe consequences.
* It was a small matter for Moses to speak to the rock instead of striking it, and his mistake cost him dearly.
* It was a small matter for Achan to hide a cloth, along with some gold and silver, but his disobedience cost him not only his life but also the lives of his entire family.
* It was a small matter for David to refrain from killing Saul in the cave, but he would rather suffer more years of hardship than kill the Lord’s anointed. And what blessings did he gain by his obedience?
* It was a small matter for Daniel and his friends to set aside their dietary restrictions and eat the king's food.
* It was a small matter for Daniel’s three friends to bow down when instructed.
* It was a small matter for Naaman to dip three times in the Jordan River.

So many stories hinging around obedience to God in even small matters. Even Jesus told a parable about the good and faithful servant who was faithful in little things.

And the smallest and most tragic matter of all? In the beginning of this world’s history, Adam and Eve were given one small command from God. It was so easy! Ignore one fruit tree out of how many dozens, hundreds or even thousands! And yet how much pain, misery, suffering and death came about because of a couple of bites of fruit. It was such a small thing! It wasn’t even in the Ten Commandments!

*But it wasn’t about the fruit\!*

***It was about obedience to God.***

And how much more tragic will it be for you and me, now at the end of earth’s history, if we eat of this fruit that God has forbidden: "Don’t do this one little thing. It’s such a small thing! My yoke is easy! All other roles are available. There are so many ways that women can be involved in serving the church, in spreading the gospel."

So do we follow God’s commandment regarding roles in the church? Or do we, like Adam and Eve, rebel against God’s explicit instructions and thus risk our eternal salvation over such a simple matter?

Think about it: is it really that difficult to obey this one simple rule, especially when the Bible shows that rule to be a matter of salvation?
