# Aramaic Primacy Notes

[Projects Page](index.md)

Aramaic Primacy is the theory that the New Testament was originally written in Aramaic instead of Greek. It is based on the false idea that Aramaic was the only language commonly spoken by the Jews in Judea and Galilee during the time of Jesus and the early apostles.

I have studied this theory extensively and have compiled some of my notes into the documents linked below.

**Abbreviations**: In these documents, I commonly use the following abbreviations:

- **AP** : Aramaic Primacy
- **1CP** : First Century Palestine
- **1CPA** : First Century Palestinian Aramaic
- **1CGA** : First Century Galilean Aramaic (Same thing as 1CPA, they are used interchangeably)
- **5CES** : Fifth Century Edessan Syriac

## Notes Regarding Aramaic Primacy

- [Summary](AramaicPrimacy-Summary.md) - Start here. This document is one of the first that I wrote to debunk AP. Many of the arguments are expanded on in the other documents.
- [Fundamental Objections](AramaicPrimacy-FundamentalObjections.md) - Another important read. This document focuses on a lot of the logical inconsistencies of AP.
- [The Languages of First Century Palestine](AramaicPrimacy-TheLanguagesOfFirstCenturyPalestine.md)
- [Josephus](AramaicPrimacy-Josephus.md)
- [The Peshitta](AramaicPrimacy-ThePeshitta.md)
- [The Original Languages of the New Testament](AramaicPrimacy-NTLanguages.md)
- [Scriptural Evidence](AramaicPrimacy-ScripturalEvidence.pdf). This document is VERY long - 36 pages and contains NUMEROUS verses with references to the Peshitta text, showing how even the Peshitta text itself disproves Aramaic Primacy's idiotic claims. I am providing a PDF file here because of formatting that gets lost if trying to use Markdown format.
