# Examining the So-Called “Missing Verses”

[Projects Page](index.md)

KJV-Onlyists make a big deal over the "Missing Verses" in modern Bible translations. The real question is this: are these verses "Missing" or "Added"? In other words, were they in the original manuscripts, and removed later, or were they added later?

What's most important to note here is that ***NONE*** of these verse text differences have any effect at all on any church doctrines.

Let's take a look:

## Matthew 17:21  

Generally considered to have been copied from Mark 9:29, although this is disputed. No Greek manuscripts prior to 5th Century contain this reading. Appeared first in Latin Vulgate, then in Greek.

## Matthew 18:11  

Copied from Luke 19:10. Not found in any Greek mss prior to 5th Century. Earliest Byz mss omit. Shows up first in LV.

## Matthew 23:14  

Copied from Mark 12:40 and Luke 20:47. Doesn’t show up until 9th Century. When it does show up, there is disagreement regarding its placement. Shows up first in LV.

## Mark 7:16  

Copied from Mark 4:9 and 4:23. Omitted from earliest Byz manuscripts. Earliest appearance: 5th Century.

## Mark 9:44 and Mark 9:46  

These verses are identical to each other and to verse 48 which is included in the main text. Omitted from earliest Byz manuscripts. Earliest appearance: 5th Century.

## Mark 11:26  

Same as Matthew 6:15. Most Byz mss omit this verse. First appears in 9th Century. Erasmus wanted to omit from Textus Receptus (and did so in 1st and 2nd editions), but was forced by Catholic Church to include in 3rd edition TR because it is in the Latin Vulgate.

## Mark 15:28  

Same as Luke 22:37. First appears in 7th Century. Earliest Byz mss omit.

## Luke 17:36  

Repeat of Matthew 24:40. Most Byz mss omit. Erasmus omitted in TR, but later editors added it. Original KJV editors doubted its authenticity and added a footnote which still shows up in many KJV editions that this verse is doubtful.

## John 5:4  

Not found prior to 5th Century in Greek. First shows up in LV. Doesn’t show up in Byz mss until 9th Century. Even when it does show up, there is a such wide range and variety of readings that scholars generally agree that this passage is spurious.

## Acts 8:37  

The evidence in favor of this verse is extremely weak. It is completely missing in Greek mss prior to the 6th Century, and not in reliable Byz mss until the 9th Century. Originated in LV. 

## Acts 15:34  

The oldest manuscripts of both text types omit this verse. Where it does show up, the wording varies significantly, making it of doubtful authenticity.

## Acts 24:6-8  

The oldest manuscripts of both text types omit this verse. Where it does show up, the wording varies, making it of doubtful authenticity.

## Acts 28:29  

Does not appear, even in Byz mss, until the 9th Century. Erasmus doubted its authenticity and included a note about his doubts in the commentary of TR.

## Romans 16:24  

These words occur in this same chapter in verse 20\. Most ancient mss (including Byz) only include verse 20\. Some early mss even end at verse 20, and there is some evidence that verses 21-24 are all later additions, since there is a wide range of wording in early manuscripts where they appear.

## 1 John 5:7-8  

The KJV reading of this verse is not found in any Greek manuscript, and was omitted in Textus Receptus 1st and 2nd editions. It was only included in TR 3rd edition because the Catholic church threatened to excommunicate Erasmus if he didn’t include it, because it was in the Vulgate.
