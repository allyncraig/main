# Biblical Perspectives on Alcohol Consumption

[Projects Page](index.md)

## Stop Drinking Only Water

People who argue that the Bible says it’s OK to drink alcohol will sometimes refer to 1 Timothy 5:23. In this verse can be read the following advice that Paul wrote to Timothy: “Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine” (NIV). On face value it appears that Paul is encouraging the use of alcohol. However, this reading takes Paul’s advice out of its full context and twists Paul’s words around to mean something quite different from what was intended.

The full verse reads as follows:

> “Stop drinking only water, and use a little wine ***because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses***”
* 1 Timothy 5:23 (emphasis added).

Paul has a reason for telling Timothy to use some wine – because he has stomach problems and is becoming ill frequently due to these stomach problems. So this verse is not as a general statement that everyone should follow all the time, but medical advice to one specific person (Timothy) for treating a specific ailment (stomach problems).

Another problem with using this verse to justify alcohol consumption is that the Greek word translated as “wine” in this text is *oinos*. The word *oinos* in Greek is used for both fermented wine and unfermented grape juice. So Paul could just as easily have been telling Timothy to consume fresh grape juice, not fermented wine.

Grape Juice is known to have medicinal properties. See [http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/15553.php](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/15553.php), [http://www.raysahelian.com/grape.html](http://www.raysahelian.com/grape.html) and other references \- go to Google and search for “medicinal benefits of grape juice”.

What about studies that show wine consumption to be medically beneficial? All of them show that it is the grape juice in the wine that is producing the medical benefits, not the alcohol, and all conclude that if one wishes to take advantage of the medical benefits, better results are always obtained by the use of unfermented grape juice.

However... it is also widely recognized that, *in the absence of better medicines*, a small amount of alcohol can be used with certain stomach ailments. Alcohol is an antiseptic and has been used since ancient times as a disinfectant. Considering that water during ancient times was not always pure, and was often the cause of stomach problems, consuming small amounts of alcohol was an effective means of ridding the digestive system of some types of infection. Fortunately, (a) we have access to cleaner water; and (b) modern medical advances have found better, less damaging ways of treating stomach ailments. Thus, in western society, alcohol consumption is entirely unnecessary for treating stomach issues.

All things considered, it is clear that Paul was not encouraging general consumption of alcohol, and may not have been talking about the alcoholic beverage at all.

## A Holy Priesthood

An additional perspective on the use of alcohol by Christians can be observed using the following texts:

### **God forbade the use of alcohol by the priests**

Leviticus 10:8-11

**8** Then the LORD said to Aaron, **9** “You and your sons are not to drink wine or other fermented drink whenever you go into the tent of meeting, or you will die. This is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come, **10** so that you can distinguish between the holy and the common, between the unclean and the clean, **11** and so you can teach the Israelites all the decrees the LORD has given them through Moses.”

### **God also forbade the use of alcohol by royalty**

Proverbs 31:4-6

**4** It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink: **5** Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted. **6** Let beer be for those who are perishing, wine for those who are in anguish\!

### **As spiritual Israel, Christians are both priests and royalty**

1 Peter 2:9

**9** But **you are** a chosen people, **a royal priesthood, a holy nation**, God’s special possession, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

Revelation 1:5, 6

**5** And from **Jesus Christ**, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, **6** And **hath made us kings and priests** unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

Notice the logical progression here:

* Alcohol use is forbidden to priests (Leviticus 10:8-11)
* Alcohol use is forbidden to royalty (Proverbs 31:4-6)
* Christians are a royal priesthood (1 Peter 2:9, Revelation 1:5, 6)

How much simpler can it be? Since alcohol is forbidden to priests and royalty, and Christians are a royal priesthood, therefore, does it not follow that Christians should avoid the use of alcohol?

Why? For the same reasons as given in the above texts:

* That we may differentiate between what is Holy and what is unholy

* That we may differentiate between what is clean and what is unclean

* That we may properly teach the Law of God (the 10 Commandments)

* That we may not forget the Law of God

* That we may not pervert judgment

### **Need Another Reason?**

### **Avoid alcohol so we can know God**

> You ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink. I did this so that you might know that I am the LORD your God.
* Deuteronomy 29:6

## Texts relating to Sobriety

All of the following verses in the New Testament use the Greek word *nephé*, which refers to abstinence from alcohol.

> So then, let us not be like others, who are asleep, but let us be awake and **sober**.
* 1 Thessalonians 5:6

> But since we belong to the day, let us be **sober**, putting on faith and love as a breastplate, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
* 1 Thessalonians 5:8

> But be **sober** in all situations, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, discharge all the duties of your ministry.
* 1 Timothy 4:5

> Therefore, with minds that are alert and fully **sober**, set your hope on the grace to be brought to you when Jesus Christ is revealed at his coming.
* 1 Peter 1:13

> The end of all things is near. Therefore be alert and **sober** so that you may pray.
* 1 Peter 4:7

> Be alert and **sober**. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.
* 1 Peter 5:8

As Christians, we are admonished by Paul to treat our bodies as temples:

> "Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? For you were bought at a price. Therefore glorify God with your body.”
* 1 Cor 6:19-20.

## Is alcohol consumption medically beneficial?

Consumption of alcohol is detrimental to our spiritual body-temples. While some people may claim that there are studies showing health benefits of alcohol consumption, no such studies exist which show clear health benefits without attendant significant health drawbacks. The book “Alcohol: All Risk, No Benefits” by Dr. Peter Landless and Duane McBride contains detailed information about the latest research in alcohol consumption, dispelling many of the commonly believed myths regarding any perceived "benefits" of alcohol.

## Conclusion

God has a better way for us and he spelled it out in the Bible. Should we not follow that plan?
