## Introduction

One universal element I have observed in ***all*** Aramaic Primacist literature and web sites is that they lean very heavily on Josephus as proof that Aramaic was the only language of First Century Judea and Galilee. In [The Languages of First Century Palestine](AramaicPrimacy-TheLanguagesOfFirstCenturyPalestine.md), I provided archaeological, historical, linguistic and literary evidence that Aramaic was not the only language spoken in 1CP.

Given this evidence, we're faced with, what I call, the Josephus dilemma: Why would Josephus claim that the Jews of 1CP spoke only Aramaic if all of the other evidence contradicts such a claim?

My first response to this is: "did he really make such a claim?" Let’s take a look at Josephus’ writings to see if we can figure out what he actually said.

## Josephus' use of *syristi* and *ebraisti*

In the works of Josephus, it is interesting to note that he uses the term *syristi* to refer to Aramaic (or Syriac), and *ebraisti* to refer to Hebrew, making a clear distinction between the two languages, never confusing the two. From the context of his writings, it is obvious that when he talks about Hebrew, he actually does mean Hebrew, and not Aramaic/Syriac or "any language of the Jews."

A few examples will illustrate this:

> “When Rabshakeh had made this speech in the Hebrew tongue, for he was skillful in that language, Eliakim was afraid lest the multitude that heard him should be disturbed; so he desired him to speak in the Syrian tongue.” (Josephus, *Antiquities of the Jews*, Book 1, Section 1)

Notice how Josephus differentiates between "the Hebrew tongue" and "the Syrian tongue." This is also a very clear indication that Hebrew was still widely spoken and understood, otherwise, how would the “multitude” have understood?

> “...whence it is that we Celebrate a rest from our labors on that day, and call it the Sabbath, which word denotes rest in the Hebrew tongue.” (Josephus, *Antiquities of the Jews*, Book 1, Section 27)

The word Sabbath comes from the Hebrew verb shabbat (שבת) meaning rest. In Syriac, the word for rest is not shabbat, but rather nach (נח) - not even close in sound to "shabbat." To be fair, the word shabbat does occur once in Peshitta, in Hebrews 4:9, but even then, it exists as a transliteration of the Hebrew word.

> "This man was called Adam, which in the Hebrew tongue signifies one that is red." (Josephus, *Antiquities of the Jews*, Book 1, Section 34)

The Hebrew word אדם (adam) is related to the word אדם (adom) 'red.' The Syriac word for "red" is סומקא (sumqa). The root אדם as a gloss for ‘red’ (or anything remotely similar) does not exist in Syriac.

> "Now a woman is called in the Hebrew tongue Issa" (Josephus, *Antiquities of the Jews*, Book 1, Section 34)

Josephus transliterates the Hebrew word אשה (isha) as issa. Since there is no “sh” sound in Greek, he used the best transliteration he could. In Syriac the word for "woman" is אנתתא (anatha). Thus, for all of these examples, Josephus had to be referring to actual Hebrew words, and could not possibly have meant Aramaic/Syriac.

Additionally, there are examples in Josephus' writings where he doesn’t explicitly state which language he’s referring to, but based on context, the language has to be Hebrew and not Aramaic. An example of this can be found in this excerpt from *The Jewish War*, 5.6.3:

> ...Now, the stones that were cast [by the Roman catapults during the siege of Jerusalem] were of the weight of a talent, and were carried two furlongs and farther. ... As for the Jews, they at first watched the coming of the stone, for it was of a white color, and could therefore not only be perceived by the great noise it made, but could be seen also before it came by its brightness; accordingly the watchmen that sat upon the towers gave them [the Jewish rebels] notice when the engine was let go, and the stone came from it, and cried aloud in their own country language, "THE SON COMETH!" so those that were in its way stood off, and threw themselves down upon the ground, by which means, and by their thus guarding themselves, the stone fell down and did them no harm. But the Romans contrived how to prevent that by blacking the stone [an effective action by the Romans], who then could aim at them with success, when the stone was not discerned beforehand, as it had been till then; and so they destroyed many of them at one blow.

Notice the phrase, “the son cometh!”. This is a correct translation of the Greek phrase “ὁ υἱὸς ἔρχεται” (*ho huios erchetai*) found in this passage. What a strange thing to say. Didn’t Josephus actually mean “stone” instead of “son”? It’s clear from the context that that’s what is intended. But the greek word for “son” (*huios*) is very different from the word for “stone” (*petros*). All translations I have seen change the phrase to “the stone cometh” either with no explanation, or, as in the case of the Whiston translation, with a lengthy footnote saying that he changed it but has no explanation for the strange word used, only that the context seems to indicate that “stone” should be used. However, E.A. Knapp has an interesting explanation:

> “The phrase, “the son cometh” is clearly a play on words, and has puzzled some scholars, convinced that Aramaic was the vernacular spoken in Jerusalem at the time of the siege. In Aramaic there is no conceivable play on words that can be constructed to explain this phrase. The understanding that Hebrew was a vernacular in Judea at this time, however, makes the solution clear. The watchmen on the walls were shouting האבן בא (*ha’eben ba*) meaning “the stone is coming”; ... Thus, when said in a hurry the phrase sounded just like the phrase הבן בא (*habben ba*), “the son cometh” ...
- E.A. Knapp, “Did the Messiah Speak Aramaic or Hebrew, Part 4”, http://www.torahclass.com/archived-articles/407-did-the-messiah-speak-aramaic-or-hebrew-part-4-by-eaknapp

From this, it is clear that Josephus was referring to Hebrew as “their own country language” (NOT Aramaic). Which means that Hebrew must have been in common usage during the time, as it makes no sense for watchmen to shout out a warning in Hebrew if nobody understood the language, especially if people’s lives were at stake.

## The "Josephus Quote" Used by Aramaic Primacists

Given this, let’s go back to the quote from Josephus - ***as incorrectly quoted by Aramaic primacists*** - *Antiquities of the Jews*, Book 20. This is the statement they try to use to “prove” that Aramaic was the only language of the Jews:

> I have also taken a great deal of pains to obtain the learning of the Greeks, and understand the elements of the Greek language, although I have so long accustomed myself to speak our own tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exactness; for our nation does not encourage those that learn the languages of many nations, on which account, as there have been many who have done their endeavors with great patience to obtain this learning, there have yet hardly been so many as two or three that have succeeded therein, who were immediately well rewarded for their pains.

While at first glance this quote does seem to agree with Aramaic Primacist claims that Aramaic was the sole language of the time. But... if you go and do your own research, and find an actual copy of Josephus' *Antiquities of the Jews* Book 20 and read the full paragraph, you’ll find that **Aramaic Primacists misquote Josephus.** They omit a significant portion in the middle of the paragraph! Here’s Josephus’ full quote, with Aramaic Primacists' omissions emphasized in bold:

> I have also taken a great deal of pains to obtain the learning of the Greeks, and understand the elements of the Greek language, although I have so long accustomed myself to speak our own tongue, that I cannot pronounce Greek with sufficient exactness; for our nation does not encourage those that learn the languages of many nations, ***and so adorn their discourses with the smoothness of their periods; because they look upon this sort of accomplishment as common, not only to all sorts of free-men, but to as many of the servants as please to learn them.*** But they give him the testimony of being a wise man who is fully acquainted with our laws, and is able to interpret their meaning; on which account, as there have been many who have done their endeavors with great patience to obtain this learning, there have yet hardly been so many as two or three that have succeeded therein, who were immediately well rewarded for their pains.

Several points to note here:

- The first part of Josephus’ quote is not saying that he doesn’t know Greek well, just that he “cannot ***pronounce*** [it] with sufficient exactness."
- “our nation does not encourage those that learn the languages of many nations” - Josephus is not saying that only one language is spoken among the Jews, but rather that learning the languages of many nations ***is not encouraged***. Big difference between the two ideas.
- “they look upon this sort of accomplishment as common” - in other words, ***language learning didn’t need to be encouraged, because it was already a common occurrence***.
- “all sorts of free-men... servants...” -  in fact, language learning was so common that it wasn't just free-men who commonly learned languages, but servants did so as well.
- “they give him the testimony...” - instead of valuing language learning, the Jews considered learning the law and the interpretation of the law as a more valuable use of time and effort.
- It is also important to note, that not only **Josephus does not claim that any particular language is exclusive to the Jews, he also does not mention any particular language by name**.

Therefore, a much more plausible understanding of this passage is that one Jewish person might have spoken Greek, another Hebrew, and another Aramaic, but since none of them would have been “encouraged” to “learn the languages of many nations,” it’s quite possible within Josephus’ meaning that none of them would have been monolingual.

In other words, what Josephus is saying is that among the Jews, they considered learning the law and interpreting the law as more important than learning languages, so language learning was not encouraged. But even then, learning the languages of other nations was still a common thing because free-men and servants did it so easily, while only two or three people had learned other languages well enough that they were “immediately well rewarded." And instead of saying that only one language was spoken, Josephus' point was rather that learning the law and the interpretation of the law was seen by the Jews as a more valuable skill.

Therefore, it is clear that Josephus cannot be construed to support the idea that Aramaic was the exclusive language of the Jews during the First Century AD.

## Appendix 1

What follows is a more extensive quote from Josephus' *Antiquities of the Jews*, Book 20. The quote actually comes near the very end of the entire book, so for completeness, and to ensure that the full quote is included and not taken out of context, I am including the full text of the last eight paragraphs of Book 20 with interlinear translation in modern English. The translation was done by ChatGPT, then reviewed and edited for clarity and correctness by a human editor. 

Josephus, *Antiquities of the Jews*, Book 20, last 8 paragraphs.

*τηρῆσαι δὲ πεπείραμαι καὶ τὴν τῶν ἀρχιερέων ἀναγραφὴν τῶν ἐν δισχιλίοις ἔτεσι γενομένων. ἀπλανῆ δὲ πεποίημαι καὶ τὴν περὶ τοὺς βασιλεῖς διαδοχὴν τὰς πράξεις αὐτῶν καὶ τὰς πολιτείας ἀπαγγέλλων μοναρχῶν τε δυναστείας, ὡς αἱ ἱεραὶ βίβλοι περὶ πάντων ἔχουσι τὴν ἀναγραφήν: τοῦτο γὰρ ποιήσειν ἐν ἀρχῇ τῆς ἱστορίας ἐπηγγειλάμην.*

> I have endeavored to preserve the record of the high priests who served over two thousand years, and I have also ensured an accurate account of the succession of kings, detailing their deeds and governance, as well as the dynasties of monarchs, just as the sacred books contain the record of all these things. Indeed, this is what I promised to do at the beginning of my history.

*λέγω δὴ θαρσήσας ἤδη διὰ τὴν τῶν προτεθέντων συντέλειαν, ὅτι μηδεὶς ἂν ἕτερος ἠδυνήθη θελήσας μήτε Ἰουδαῖος μήτε ἀλλόφυλος τὴν πραγματείαν ταύτην οὕτως ἀκριβῶς εἰς Ἕλληνας ἐξενεγκεῖν:*

> Now, with confidence, I declare—having completed the tasks I set out to do—that no one else, whether a Jew or a foreigner, could have carried out this work with such precision and brought it to the Greeks.

*ἔχω γὰρ ὁμολογούμενον παρὰ τῶν ὁμοεθνῶν πλεῖστον αὐτῶν κατὰ τὴν ἐπιχώριον παιδείαν διαφέρειν καὶ τῶν Ἑλληνικῶν δὲ γραμμάτων ἐσπούδασα μετασχεῖν τὴν γραμματικὴν ἐμπειρίαν ἀναλαβών, τὴν δὲ περὶ τὴν προφορὰν ἀκρίβειαν πάτριος ἐκώλυσεν συνήθεια.*

> I am acknowledged by my own people as surpassing most of them in our traditional education, and I have also made a great effort to engage with Greek literature, acquiring expertise in its grammar, though my native customs have hindered my ability to achieve perfect accuracy in pronunciation.

*παρ᾽ ἡμῖν γὰρ οὐκ ἐκείνους ἀποδέχονται τοὺς πολλῶν ἐθνῶν διάλεκτον ἐκμαθόντας διὰ τὸ κοινὸν εἶναι νομίζειν τὸ ἐπιτήδευμα τοῦτο μόνον οὐκ ἐλευθέροις τοῖς τυχοῦσιν ἀλλὰ καὶ τῶν οἰκετῶν τοῖς θέλουσι, μόνοις δὲ σοφίαν μαρτυροῦσιν τοῖς τὰ νόμιμα σαφῶς ἐπισταμένοις καὶ τὴν τῶν ἱερῶν γραμμάτων δύναμιν ἑρμηνεῦσαι δυναμένοις.*

> Among us, people do not admire those who have learned the dialects of many nations, since they consider this skill to be common and not exclusive to free individuals, but something even ordinary slaves can achieve if they wish. Instead, they recognize true wisdom only in those who clearly understand the laws and are capable of interpreting the meaning and power of the sacred writings.

*διὰ τοῦτο πολλῶν πονησάντων περὶ τὴν ἄσκησιν ταύτην μόλις δύο τινὲς ἢ τρεῖς κατώρθωσαν καὶ τῶν πόνων τὴν ἐπικαρπίαν εὐθὺς ἔλαβον.*

> For this reason, although many have labored in this practice, only two or three have succeeded, and they immediately reaped the rewards of their efforts.

*ἴσως δ᾽ οὐκ ἂν ἐπίφθονον γένοιτο καὶ περὶ γένους τοὐ μοῦ καὶ περὶ τῶν κατὰ τὸν βίον πράξεων βραχέα διεξελθεῖν ἕως ἔχω ζῶντας ἢ τοὺς ἐλέγξοντας ἢ τοὺς μαρτυρήσοντας.*

> It might not be out of place, and perhaps not cause envy, to briefly discuss my lineage and the events of my life, while I still have living witnesses who can either refute or confirm my account.

*Ἐπὶ τούτοις δὲ καταπαύσω τὴν ἀρχαιολογίαν βιβλίοις μὲν εἴκοσι περιειλημμένην, ἓξ δὲ μυριάσι στίχων, κἂν τὸ θεῖον ἐπιτρέπῃ κατὰ περιδρομὴν ὑπομνήσω πάλιν τοῦ τε πολέμου καὶ τῶν συμβεβηκότων ἡμῖν μέχρι τῆς νῦν ἐνεστώσης ἡμέρας, ἥτις ἐστὶν τρισκαιδεκάτου μὲν ἔτους τῆς Δομετιανοῦ Καίσαρος ἀρχῆς, ἐμοὶ δ᾽ ἀπὸ γενέσεως πεντηκοστοῦ τε καὶ ἕκτου.*

> With this, I will conclude my work on ancient history, which is contained in twenty books and sixty thousand lines. If the divine permits, I will later, in a summary form, recount the war and the events that have happened to us up to the present day, which is the thirteenth year of Emperor Domitian Caesar’s reign and my fifty-sixth year since birth.

*προῄρημαι δὲ συγγράψαι κατὰ τὰς ἡμετέρας δόξας τῶν Ἰουδαίων ἐν τέσσαρσι βίβλοις περὶ θεοῦ καὶ τῆς οὐσίας αὐτοῦ καὶ περὶ τῶν νόμων, διὰ τί κατ᾽ αὐτοὺς τὰ μὲν ἔξεστιν ἡμῖν ποιεῖν, τὰ δὲ κεκώλυται.*

> I have also decided to write, in four books, about the beliefs of the Jews concerning God and His essence, as well as our laws, explaining why, according to them, we are permitted to do some things while others are forbidden.
