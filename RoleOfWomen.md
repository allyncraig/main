# The Role of Women in the Church

[Projects Page](index.md)

## Is This a Matter of Sin?

This discussion examines the role of women in the church using a *Sola Scriptura* approach. Too often, arguments on this topic rely on cultural assumptions or extra-biblical reasoning. Instead, this paper seeks to determine what conclusions—if any—can be drawn **solely from Scripture**, particularly from:

* 1 Corinthians 14:34–35
* 1 Timothy 2:11–12

> *“Let the women keep silent in the churches…”* (1 Cor 14:34–35)[^1]  
> *“I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man…”* (1 Tim 2:11–12)[^2]

At first glance, two foundational questions arise:

1. **How important are these passages?** Are they merely cultural guidance, or do they affect salvation?
2. **What do they mean in practice?** How do we move from Paul’s instructions to concrete church roles such as pastors and elders?

These questions must be addressed carefully and biblically.

## How Important Are These Passages?

Scripture teaches that *“the wages of sin is death”* (Rom 6:23), and that *“sin is the transgression of the law”* (1 John 3:4). If disobedience to God’s law results in sin, then determining whether these passages constitute “law” is critical.

In 1 Corinthians 14:34, Paul explicitly grounds his instruction in “the Law.” The surrounding context strengthens this claim:

> *“As in all the churches of the saints…”* (v. 33)  
> *“just as the law also says.”* (v. 34)  
> *“The things I am writing to you are a commandment of the Lord.”* (v. 37)  
> *“If anyone ignores this, he is to be ignored.”* (v. 38)[^3]

Likewise, Paul roots his instruction in 1 Timothy 2 not in culture, but in creation itself:

> *“For Adam was created first, then Eve.”* (1 Tim 2:13)

From the text itself, several conclusions follow:

* These instructions apply to **all churches**, not a single congregation.
* Paul explicitly calls them **the law** and **a commandment of the Lord**.
* Disregard for them carries **church-level consequences**.
* Their grounding in creation places them **prior to sin**, not within a cultural moment.

If breaking God’s law constitutes sin (1 John 3:4), and sin leads to death (Rom 6:23), then Scripture itself frames this issue as spiritually significant. This conclusion relies entirely on biblical premises.

## Do Other Scriptures Contradict This?

Some appeal to Galatians 3:28 (*“there is neither male nor female”*) as a counterargument. However, this text addresses **equal access to salvation**, not church authority or spiritual gifts. Combining it with 1 Corinthians 14 creates a contradiction if the passages are forced into the same category.

This is similar to combining Genesis 4:8 (*Cain killed his brother, Abel*) with Luke 10:37 (*“Jesus said, Go and do likewise!”*). Context determines meaning. Galatians 3 concerns justification and unity in Christ (SDA Fundamental Belief #7); 1 Corinthians 14 concerns **church order and spiritual gifts** (SDA Fundamental Belief #17). Scripture does not present these as competing ideas.

Notably, no biblical text overturns Paul’s declaration that these instructions are commandments of the Lord.

## What Do These Verses Mean?

The passages do not explicitly mention “pastors” or “elders.” To understand their application, Scripture must interpret Scripture.

The broader context of 1 Corinthians 14 (and indeed chapters 12–14) is **spiritual gifts**, particularly those involving public speaking and authority within the congregation. Any interpretation of verses 33–38 that ignores this context fails the *Sola Scriptura* test (and must also be incompatible with SDA Fundamental Belief #1).

Two specific restrictions appear:

1. **Speaking** (1 Cor 14:34)
2. **Teaching and exercising authority** (1 Tim 2:12)

The Greek term translated “speak” consistently refers to **public proclamation or preaching**, not casual conversation. Within a chapter devoted to regulating public worship and spiritual gifts, the most reasonable conclusion is that Paul is restricting **authoritative, public speaking Spiritual Gift roles**.

Pastors and elders, as described in Ephesians 4:11 and Romans 12:8, are spiritual gifts roles associated with preaching and authority. Therefore, restricting these roles to men aligns naturally with Paul’s instructions. No alternative modern practice satisfies all the biblical constraints simultaneously.

## Is This a Sin?

If pastoral and elder roles are spiritual gifts involving preaching and authority, and if Scripture presents their restriction as a universal commandment established at creation, then allowing women to occupy these roles constitutes disobedience to that command.

By biblical definition, disobedience to God’s law is sin.

## Why Would God Command This?

Many biblical practices—Sabbath, baptism, communion, tithing—appear inconvenient or even strange until their symbolic meaning is understood. Each symbolizes different aspects of our relationship with Jesus Christ.

Scripture repeatedly portrays God as husband, shepherd, or head, and His people as bride, flock, or body (Eph 5:23; Rev 19:7–9; Hosea; Isaiah 54:5). Male headship in the church functions as a **symbolic affirmation of Christ’s headship** over His people.

Seen this way, restricting pastoral headship to men is not about diminishing women, but about **exalting Christ**. Reversing the symbol risks portraying the church as self-led rather than Christ-led.

## “Such a Small Matter”

Scripture repeatedly shows that “small” acts of disobedience carry great consequences:

* Cain’s improper offering
* Moses striking the rock
* Achan’s hidden garment
* Adam and Eve’s forbidden fruit

In each case, the issue was not the act itself, but obedience.

Jesus Himself taught that faithfulness in small things reveals faithfulness in great ones.

---

## Conclusion

The question is not whether this command is difficult to obey, but whether obedience matters. Scripture consistently teaches that it does.

If God has clearly spoken, and if His command concerns church order, symbolism, and obedience, then the choice before us mirrors that faced throughout biblical history:

Will we submit to God’s instruction, or redefine it according to our preferences?

According to Scripture, the stakes are not small.
