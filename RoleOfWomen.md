# The Role of Women in the Church

[Projects Page](README.md)

## The Problem

I have been following the issue of Women’s Role in the Church for many years. And for quite a while I did not take a particular stance on either side of the issue.

On the one hand, when I listened to sermons or read articles by those advocating for allowing women to fill all roles in the church, I was never able to accept their position for multiple reasons:

* Different presenters provided contrasting, often contradictory evidence to support their positions;
* Or they would use extra-biblical “evidence” to support their position, in contradiction to SDA Fundamental Belief #1 and the principle of *Sola Scriptura*;
* Or they would cite false information, such as that the verses are a reference to churches being segregated because that was the Jewish practice, early Christians followed Jewish customs, and women would have a question about the sermon so they would stand up and shout to their husbands across the aisle asking for an explanation - an obviously false idea because the Jews didn’t start segregating their synagogues until the 7th Century AD, 600+ years after Paul wrote these instructions;
* Or they would quote misapplied scriptural references, such as Gal 3:28 which is about the universality of the Gospel (SDA fundamental belief #7), while the context of 1 Cor 14 is spiritual gifts (SDA fundamental belief #17), two completely separate topics, which if you attempt to apply them together would create a contradiction in the Bible;
* Or they would tear down the Bible and say that we can ignore these verses completely, as did one “Adventist” pastor in a sermon when he said that Paul was schizophrenic when he wrote 1 Cor 14:34,35 and that we can, therefore ignore what he wrote, obviously in contradiction to 2 Tim 3:16, “for all scripture is inspired by God and is useful for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” If Paul was schizophrenic, then how could we trust anything he wrote, and how could it be true that all scripture is inspired by God? And if we can discard this piece of scripture, then what else can we discard from the Bible just because we don’t agree with it?

However, when I listened to sermons or read articles by those supporting the traditional view that women should not be pastors and elders, something was missing.

In fact, a common response I would hear from many Adventists when asked about this topic, was “It’s not that important. There are more important issues. Show me where in the Bible it says that we will lose our salvation if we allow women to be pastors or elders. If you can't, then the issue is not important and I’m not going to worry about it.”

This is a critical question that nobody seemed to be addressing! Will we lose our salvation if we allow women to be pastors and elders?

If it’s not a matter of salvation, then why should we care? But if the Bible says that it is a matter of salvation, then we should do our utmost to make sure that we are following the Bible’s instructions.

## Looking for a Solution

For a long time, I didn't care much either way. I figured, "If nobody has found an answer so far, then maybe there isn't really an answer, and, like everyone says, It's not that important."

But at one point I became dissatisfied with that answer. I thought, "Maybe there really is something in the Bible that can tell us either way. I can at least look." To be honest, I didn't expect to find anything definitive.

But after searching, I did find something. It turns out that there is an answer. You see, everyone has been so hyper-focused on verses 34,35 of 1 Corinthians chapter 14, and verses 11,12 of 1 Timothy chapter 2 that we missed the context - the surrounding verses, and it is in these surrounding verses where we can find the answers to why the role of women in the church is so important.

Before I discuss the answer, I want to point out there are three important questions to answer here:

1. What do the verses of 1 Corinthians 14:34,35 and 1 Timothy 2:11,2 really mean as far as what women can and cannot do?
2. Is this a matter of Divine Instruction or Cultural Preferences?
3. Is this really important enough to be an issue of salvation?

I believe that a 100% *Sola Scriptura* answer can be provided for all three questions.

## The Solution

It is always important, when reading the Bible, to make sure that you're not taking verses out of context. So the first thing to do is to take a step back from just verses 34, 35 of 1 Corinthians chapter 14, and look at the overall context of chapter 14 and possibly surrounding chapters.

In fact, let's start in chapter 12 of 1 Corinthians. Chapter 12 is all about Spiritual Gifts.

Moving on to Chapter 13, it's widely known as "The Love Chapter of the Bible." But if you look closely at the subtext, you will find that this chapter, also, is about Spiritual Gifts\!

Notice all of the Spiritual Gifts references: "If I ***speak in the tongues*** of men and angels..." (v1), "If I have the ***gift of prophecy***, and can ***fathom all mysteries*** and ***all knowledge***... ***absolute faith***" (v2), "If all I have I ***give to the poor***, ... ***surrender my body (martyrdom)***..." (v3), "... ***prophecies*** ... ***tongues*** ... ***knowledge*** ..." (v8), "... ***know***... ***prophesy*** ..." (v9). ALL OF THESE ARE SPIRITUAL GIFTS\!

Next, in Chapter 14, we see that it starts and ends with references to Spiritual Gifts: "Earnestly pursue love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy." (v1) and "So, my brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues." (v30).

So 1 Corinthians chapters 12, 13 and 14 are all about Spiritual Gifts:
* Chapter 12 is an overview of Spiritual Gifts;
* Chapter 13 says that we must use our Spiritual Gifts in loving service to God and Man, else they are wasted;
* Chapter 14 is instructions about the proper use of Spiritual Gifts in the church.

So, since the entirety of 1 Corinthians chapter 14 is about spiritual gifts, and the proper use of spiritual gifts in church services, **if an interpretation does not take this into account**, and does not look at verses 34,35 in this context, then that understanding has missed the point, it is taking the verses out of context, and **it must necessarily be false**.

Since the vast majority of interpretations of these verses do not take this into account, we can easily dismiss them and focus only on the one interpretations that does look at these verses in the context of Spiritual Gifts: that they relate to restrictions on the Spiritual Gift roles that women may hold in the church.

The roles of pastor and elder are spiritual gifts (see Ephesians 4:11 and Romans 12:8), so Paul forbidding these roles to women would fit in the context. And it is the ***only*** interpretation that fits in the context.

And while this is a key detail that helps understand these verses, it is not the only detail. Not only should we look at the larger context (chapters 12 through 14), we should also look at the verses surrounding 1 Cor 14:34,35 and 1 Tim 2:11,12.

With that in mind, in 1 Cor 14 let's expand from only looking at verses 34,35 to also look at verses 33 through 38. Similarly, let's add verse 13 to 1 Timothy 2:11,12. I'll add some emphasis to point out a few key elements:

> “<sup>33</sup> since God is not a God of disorder but of peace. ***As in all the churches of the saints***, <sup>34</sup> the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but are to submit themselves, ***as the law also says***. <sup>35</sup> If they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands at home, since it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. <sup>36</sup> Or did the word of God originate from you, or did it come to you only? <sup>37</sup> If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that ***what I write to you is the Lord's commandment***. <sup>38</sup> ***If anyone ignores this, he should be ignored***.”
* 1 Cor 14:33-38

> “<sup>11</sup> A woman is to learn quietly with full submission. <sup>12</sup> I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; instead, she is to remain quiet. <sup>13</sup> ***For Adam was created first, then Eve***.”
* 1 Tim 2:11-13

Notice the additional details that these extra verses bring to the overall context:

- This is for all the churches of the saints, not just the local Corinthian church;
- This is the law, and therefore a matter of salvation;
- This is the law, ***AND*** a commandment from God;
- Those who ignore this commandment should be ignored, or kicked out of the church;
- This law/commandment was established when “Adam was created first,” and thus has been in effect since before sin.

Note that Paul says that this is the Law and a Commandment from God.

Reasoning from scripture, if we break this one law, we break the whole law (James 2:10), sin is the transgression of the law (1 John 3:4), and the wages of sin is death (Romans 6:23). In other words, the Bible itself tells us that this matter is such a big deal that our salvation is affected.

## What does it all mean?

But that’s not all. I eventually realized that there’s more to it than just that. After all, why should this be a law and a matter of salvation? Why should we pay attention to this ritual that seems to push women down?

Consider for a moment some other strange rituals that we diligently observe in the Adventist Church: the Sabbath, Baptism, Communion and Tithing. These are all important elements of our faith, but they are also a bit strange. Strange, that is, until you look at them in the context that they are symbols of different aspects of our relationship with Jesus.

Could it be that the male-only headship in the church is also a symbol of yet another aspect of our relationship with Jesus Christ? Isn’t the Bible full of symbols where God portrays himself as the man, husband, pastor or shepherd and his people as the woman, wife, congregation or flock? “For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.” Ephesians 5:23.

Every Sabbath we inconvenience ourselves to cease our normal activities and rest to symbolically recognize Jesus as our creator. Similarly, when we inconvenience ourselves to appoint men only as pastors and elders, we symbolically recognize Jesus as the head of the church. Instead of looking at this ritual as pushing women down, we should look at it as lifting Jesus up as the rightful head of the church and portraying women as the beautiful and pure bride of Christ.

Consider also, that since women symbolize the people, appointing a woman as pastor or elder would be portraying the people as leading the church and is the equivalent to saying that we, the church, don’t need Jesus, and we can save ourselves. Wouldn't that be spiritual treason?

Could this be why it is so important for us, as a church, to keep this commandment and not allow women to fill the roles of pastor and elder?

## Such a Small Matter

It may seem like it’s a small matter to allow women to fill all roles in the church, but remember that the Bible is filled with stories showing that even small matters can make a big difference:

* It was a small matter for Moses to speak to the rock instead of striking it, and his mistake cost him dearly.
* It was a small matter for Achan to hide a cloth, along with some gold and silver, but his disobedience cost him not only his life but also the lives of his entire family.
* It was a small matter for David to refrain from killing Saul in the cave, but he would rather suffer more years of hardship than kill the Lord’s anointed. And what blessings did he gain by his obedience?
* It was a small matter for Daniel’s three friends to bow down when instructed.
* It was a small matter for Naaman to dip three times in the Jordan River.

So many stories hinging around obedience to God in even small matters. Even Jesus told a parable about the good and faithful servant who was faithful in little things.

And the smallest and most tragic matter of all? In the beginning of this world’s history, Adam and Eve were given one small command from God. It was so easy! Ignore one fruit tree out of how many dozens, hundreds or even thousands! And yet how much pain, misery, suffering and death came about because of a couple of bites of fruit. It was such a small thing! It wasn’t even in the Ten Commandments!

*But it wasn’t about the fruit\!*

***It was about obedience to God.***

And how much more tragic will it be for you and me, now at the end of earth’s history, if we eat of this fruit that God has forbidden: "Don’t do this one little thing. It’s such a small thing! My yoke is easy! All other roles are available. There are so many ways that women can be involved in serving the church, in spreading the gospel."

So do we follow God’s commandment regarding roles in the church? Or do we, like Adam and Eve, rebel against God’s explicit instructions and thus risk our eternal salvation over such a simple matter?

Think about it: is it really that difficult to obey this one simple rule, especially when the Bible shows that rule to be a matter of salvation?
