# Destroying KJV-Onlyism

[Projects Page](README.md)

What Follows is a bunch of disjointed notes that I have collected from various sources.

## Basic Argument to Refute KJV-Onlyism

1. What is KJV-Onlyism?
   1. The idea that the KJV is the only valid version of the English Bible. All other English Bible translations are corrupted and shouldn’t be used.
2. Core Claims and Arguments
   1. KJV is Pure (supposedly, according to KJV onlyists) and was Uncorrupted by the *Latin Vulgate* because:
      1. KJV NT translated was from *Textus Receptus* without influence from the *Latin Vulgate*
      2. *Textus Receptus* was compiled by Erasmus from Byzantine Text Type Manuscripts, without influence from *Latin Vulgate* or the Catholic Church
      3. Byzantine Text Type Manuscripts are the majority text type, they are “pure” and uncorrupted by *Latin Vulgate* influence, and thus they are the closest to the original text of the NT.
   2. Modern versions are corrupt (supposedly, according to KJV onlyists) because :
      1. The NT of most modern translations is translated from texts derived from Westcott-Hort (such as mGNT, SBL, UBS, or Nestle-Aland)
      2. Westcott-Hort mostly relied on Alexandrian Text Type Manuscripts (in particular *Codex Sinaiticus* and *Codex Vaticanus*)
      3. Alexandrian Text Type Manuscripts are minority, and corrupted by influence from *Latin Vulgate*
      4. Especially manuscripts like *Codex Sinaiticus* are the spawn of Satan, trash, fully corrupted, and heavily edited. So, since Westcott-Hort, mGNT, Nestle-Aland and most modern text-critical Greek editions are based on *Codex Siniaticus*, and because most modern Bible translations are based on these Greek editions, therefore most modern Bibles are worthless at best.
   3. In some extreme cases, KJV-only advocates even claim that other modern translations that use *Textus Receptus* are also corrupted, and that only the KJV is entirely free from both the corruption of the past (*Latin Vulgate*) and present (modern spiritualism), so only the KJV is “safe."
3. Why the Core Idea of KJV-onlyism is provably wrong
   1. Without even getting into the whole discussion about Alexandrian vs Byzantine text types, or Westcott-Hort vs Textus Receptus...
   2. Start at the beginning and cut it off at the roots: "KJV NT translated from Textus Receptus without influence from Latin Vulgate” \- ***This is a false claim***
   3. KJV is NOT a TRANSLATION, it is an EDITION
   4. KJV was not translated from scratch, it was edited from a previous Bible (the Bishops Bible). King James II didn’t ask the committee to create a new translation, and the committee didn’t claim to have created a new translation. From the Committee's introduction to the KJV First Edition:
      > “But it is high time … to show in brief what we proposed to ourselves, and what course we held in this our perusal and survey of the Bible. Truly (good Christian Reader) we never thought from the beginning, that we should need to make a new Translation, nor yet to make of a bad one a good one, … but to make a good one better… that hath been our endeavor, that our mark.”
   6. King James II asked the committee to edit the Bishops Bible of 1568 to remove objectionable, Catholic, terminology and replace it with Church of England terminology so that the Church of England could have a Church of England Bible for use in Church of England congregations for preaching Church of England sermons so they could prove Church of England doctrines and make converts to the Church of England. In other words, the KJV is explicitly a Church of England Bible. When the committee finished their work and reported back to the king, they said that they followed his instructions. They gave him a Church of England Bible\!
   7. Not only that, but they couldn’t have created a new translation from the original Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek even if they wanted to: None of the committee members knew Aramaic, and most of them didn’t know any Hebrew or Greek. Only two knew Hebrew well enough, and only one of the committee members knew Greek well enough to do scholarly-level translation work. Again, from the Committee's comments in the First Edition:
      > “Therefore such were thought upon, as could say modestly with Saint Jerome, *Et Hebraeum Sermonem ex parte didicimus, et in Latino pene ab ipsis incunabulis etc. detriti sumus.* Both we have learned the Hebrew tongue in part, and in the Latin we have been exercised almost from our very cradle.”  <br>    
   8. Instead, the surviving committee notes show that when they did refer to ancient languages, most of the time they used the *Latin Vulgate*\! Of course, when they did their editing work, they occasionally referred to Hebrew and Greek:
      > “If you ask what they had before them, truly it was the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, the Greek of the New.”
   9. But they also referred to other sources:
      > “Neither did we think much to consult the Translators or Commentators, Chaldee, Hebrew, Syrian, Greek or Latin, no nor the Spanish, French, Italian, or Dutch;...”
   10. As for the Bishops Bible, it was based on Miles Coverdale’s Great Bible of 1539 which was a successor to Miles Coverdale’s own Coverdale Bible of 1535\. The Coverdale Bible was, in turn, based on Tyndale’s work, a set of translations of all of the New Testament and portions of the Old Testament which he had not completed when he died in 1535\. Tyndale’s translations were also based in part on Wycliffe’s translations.  So basically, we have this editorial sequence:
   11. Wycliffe \> Tyndale \> Coverdale \> Great Bible \> Bishops Bible \> KJV
   12. You can easily see Wycliffe’s and Tyndale’s influence on the KJV as KJV is about 70% word for word the same as Wyclyffe’s text, and Tyndale’s NT is about 85% word for word the same as the KJV NT.
   13. What sources did each of these translators/editors base their work on?
       1. Wycliffe used Latin Vulgate (LV) exclusively.
       2. Tyndale used LV primarily with some reference to Martin Luther’s German Bible and Erasmus’ Latin Text, and some minor reference to Hebrew and Greek;
       3. Coverdale primarily used LV plus various German protestant translations;
       4. The Great Bible was same as the Coverdale Bible (since both were produced by Coverdale);
       5. the Bishops Bible was mostly LV with some Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek references;
       6. and as mentioned before, KJV was mostly LV with some Hebrew and Greek references.
   14. So all of the KJV-onlyist arguments about the KJV being pure and unadulterated by influence from the Latin Vulgate are laughable fiction. The exact opposite is true: ***KJV is almost entirely based on the Latin Vulgate***\! In fact, textual analyses have shown that where the LV differs from Greek in the NT, the KJV follows the LV about 70% of the time, and the Greek about 5% of the time, with the remaining readings often showing an influence of LV origin. The KJV is absolutely, 100%, undeniably, first and foremost, a product of the Latin Vulgate. And if that is a criterion for accepting or rejecting a Bible version, then KJV should be immediately rejected.

So that's it. The basic claim of KJV-Onlyism is that KJV is superior because it is entirely free from *Latin Vulgate* influence, but the facts show the exact opposite to be true. It is also not a translation at all. These two facts completely destroy the entire KJV-only narrative.

*Does this mean that KJV Should not be used at all?* No!

For those of you who actually have a brain, and trust in God and his ability to protect his word from Satan and from worldly influences, neither the KJV, nor modern Bible versions should be rejected.
   * It is possible to demonstrate all SDA beliefs from the Latin Vulgate.
   * It is possible to demonstrate all SDA beliefs from the KJV
   * It is possible to demonstrate all SDA beliefs from all reliably-produced modern Bible Versions

How is this possible? Because God is in control\! God is protecting his word. Stop being prejudiced against different versions. If the KJV works for you, USE IT! If modern versions work for you, USE THEM! If the Latin Vulgate works for you, USE IT TOO!

But don't limit yourself - or others - to just one Bible. Use multiple translations. No one translation is best for all peope for all situations.

While we’re here, let’s disprove another key KJV-onlyism claim...
   1. KJV-onlyists revile and despise the *Codex Sinaiticus* manuscript that most modern Greek Text Critical editions are based on, claiming that it is heavily influenced by the Latin Vulgate text. But the problem with their claims is this:
      1. *Codex Sinaiticus* was produced sometime between 325 and 360 AD. These are provable dates based on internal evidence in the manuscript.
      2. Jerome was commissioned to create a new Latin translation of the Gospels which were to become the basis of the *Latin Vulgate* in 382 AD
      3. So Jerome didn’t start working on the Latin Vulgate until at least TWENTY TWO YEARS AFTER the Codex Sinaiticus had already been created.
      4. How is it possible for Codex Sinaiticus to have been corrupted by the *Latin Vulgate* if the it didn’t even exist when *Codex Sinaiticus* was produced?
   2. Interesting note that would be shocking to some SDAs who follow KJV-only ideas: the *Codex Sinaiticus* manuscript that you so despise... back in the 1800s, shortly after *Codex Sinaiticus* (CS) was discovered, a guy named Noyce made a scholarly translation into English using ONLY the CS manuscript. This Noyce translation is out of print these days, but it is available online. But a curious fact about this Noyce translation is that, according to Willie White, Ellen White’s son, Ellen White’s favorite translation that she used most in her own personal devotions was the Noyce translation, and she also quoted from it multiple times in her writings. If you are SDA and consider Ellen White to be a prophet inspired by God, then you are despising a manuscript that is the source of her favorite Bible translation.
      1. If you claim to be Adventist and also follow KJV-onlyism, then you need to make a decision: You need to choose between your KJV-onlyism or Ellen White because you can’t have both. KJV-onlyism is provably wrong. Ellen White has never been proven wrong. The choice should be clear.

## Verses Different Between KJV and NIV

1. **Matt. 5:22** (UBS4 omits 'without cause' \[B\]) \- Has no effect on Christian doctrine: Jesus is demanding we must be perfect \- as he also says in (say) Matthew 5:48. \[Of course we cannot by ourselves be perfect, which is why we need a Saviour\].

   **KJV**: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother **without a cause** shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.

   **NIV**: But I tell you that anyone who is angry with a brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to a brother, 'Raca,' is answerable to the court. And anyone who says, 'You fool\!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.

2. **Matt 6:13** (UBS4 omits 'For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever'). They were apparently added to match church practice. While this addition is unfortunate, there is no effect on doctrine. (Note from Matthew 6:5-9 that Jesus is not teaching a rote prayer, but a general way of praying).

   **KJV**: And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: **For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.**

   **NIV**: And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'

3. **Matt 12:47** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- assimilated from Mark 3:32

   **KJV**: Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

   **NIV**: Someone told him, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.” (With footnote that many manuscripts do not include this verse. Verse not included in ESV.)

4. **Matt 17:21** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- assimilated from Mark 9:29

   **KJV**: Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

   **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

5. **Matt 18:11** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- assimilated from Luke 19:10

   **KJV**: For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

   **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

6. **Matt. 21:7** \- (some manuscripts changed 'them' to 'him', because a scribe thought it was odd that Jesus would sit on two donkeys). But the 'them' refers to the garments, not the donkeys \- so the scribe had no need to correct it. The verse makes sense as it stands.

   **KJV**: And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set *him* thereon.

   **NIV**: They brought the donkey and the colt and placed their cloaks on them for Jesus to sit on.

7. **Matt. 21:44** \- (UBS4 omits entire verse). Some early manuscripts contain the verse, while others do not, so its authenticity is uncertain. It is a copy of Luke 20:18, and contains nothing that affects doctrine, so its removal or inclusion does not have any effect.

   **KJV**: And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

   **NIV**: Anyone who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; anyone on whom it falls will be crushed. (With footnote that many manuscripts do not include this verse)

8. **Matt 23:14** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- assimilated from Mark 12:20 and Luke 20:47

   **KJV**: Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites\! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.

   **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

9. **Matt 27:35** (UBS4 omits reference to prophecy) \- assimilated from John 19:24.

   **KJV**: And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.

   **NIV**: When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.

10. **Mark 1:1** ('Son of God' may not be original, although UBS4 decides it probably is original. It is missing from several key early manuscripts and first appears in 3rd Century manuscripts) \- No doctrine is affected, because Jesus is called 'Son of God' more than 100 times in the New Testament, including Mark 14:61-62.

    **KJV**: The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;

    **NIV**: The beginning of the good news about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God. (With footnote about authenticity of *Son of God*)

11. **Mark 6:11** (UBS omits second sentence): assimilated from Matthew 10:15

    **KJV**: And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you, when ye depart thence, shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them. **Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.**

    **NIV**: And if any place will not welcome you or listen to you, leave that place and shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.

12. **Mark 7:16** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- copied from Mark 4:9 or 4:23

    **KJV**: If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

13. **Mark 9:44, 46** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- copied from Mark 9:48

    **KJV**: Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

14. **Mark 11:26** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- assimilated from Matt 6:15

    **KJV**: But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

15. **Mark 15:28** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- assimilated from Luke 22:37

    **KJV**: And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

16. **Mark 16:9-20** See discussion below.

17. **Luke 4:44** (UBS4: 'Synagogues of Judea' \[B\]; TR: 'Synagogues of Galilee') \- Since John's gospel indicates Jesus has an early ministry in Judea, and Matt 4:23 and Mark 1:39 indicate an early ministry in Galilee, either reading is historically correct. Both regions are mentioned in the earliest manuscripts. There is no theological reason to prefer one over the other.

    **KJV**: And he preached in the synagogues of **Galilee**.

    **NIV**: And he **kept on** preaching in the synagogues of **Judea**.

18. **Luke 9:55-56** (UBS4 omits end of 55, beginning of 56\) \- assimilated from Luke 19:10

    **KJV**: (55) But he turned, and rebuked them, **and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.** (56) **For the Son of man is not come to destroy men's lives, but to save *them***. And they went to another village.

    **NIV**: (55) But Jesus turned and rebuked them. (56) Then he and his disciples went to another village.

19. **Luke 11:2-4** (TR is similar to Lord's Prayer in Matthew 6:9-13; UBS4 has it much shorter) \- Since the longer version is included in Matthew 6:9-13, there is no doctrine affected. The meaning behind the two prayers is identical (both have the same 5 key points). So why were the two prayers different in the first place? They are different because they describe two different sermons. Matthew's is from a sermon on a mountain to a crowd (Matthew 5:1), Luke's is in response to a private question (Luke 11:1).

    **KJV**: And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; **but deliver us from evil**.

    **NIV**: Forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. And lead us not into temptation.

20. **Luke 17:36** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- assimilated from Matt 24:40.

    **KJV**: Two *men* shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

21. **Luke 23:17** (UBS4 omits entire verse) \- assimilated from Matt 27:15, Mark 15:6.

    **KJV**: For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

22. **John 5:4** (UBS4 omits) \- Deals with a specific incident and has no bearing on doctrine.

    **KJV**: For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

23. **Acts 8:37** (UBS4 omits verse) \- Deals with a specific incident and has no bearing on doctrine.

    **KJV**: And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

24. **Acts 15:34** (UBS4 omits verse) \- Deals with a specific incident and has no bearing on doctrine.

    **KJV**: Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

25. **Acts 24:6b-8a** (UBS4 omits end of 6 through beginning of 8\) \- Deals with a specific incident and has no bearing on doctrine.

    **KJV**: (6) Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, **and would have judged according to our law.** (7) **But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,** (8) **Commanding his accusers to come unto thee:** by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.

    **NIV**: (6) and even tried to desecrate the temple; so we seized him. (8) By examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him.

26. **Acts 28:29** (UBS4 omits verse) \- Deals with a specific incident and has no bearing on doctrine.

    **KJV**: And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

27. **Romans 16:24** (UBS4 omits verse) \- copied from Romans 16:20.

    **KJV**: The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ *be* with you all. Amen.

    **NIV**: \[\[\[OMIT\]\]\]

28. **1 Timothy 3:16** (UBS4: 'which was manifest in the flesh' \[A\]; TR: 'God was manifest in the flesh') \- UBS4 considers the mistake to be accidental, since the Greek words 'hos' (who/which) and 'theos' (God) looked quite similar. But of course the doctrine of the incarnation was present well before this mistake was made: the two clearest passages are John 1:1-18 and Philippians 2:5-11.

    **KJV**: And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: **God** was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.

    **NIV**: Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great: **He** appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, was taken up in glory.

29. **1 John 5:7, 8** (*Johannine Comma* \- UBS4 omits): 1 John 5:7 has long been known not to be original. It was never in the Greek manuscripts (the original language of the New Testament), but surfaced in the LATIN translation in the fifth century, AFTER the Trinity doctrine had been accepted. The source for this reading appears to be a 'gloss' (a marginal comment in a Bible) that accidentally found its way into the Latin Bible. Due to some unfortunate politics, Erasmus (who compared various manuscripts in the 16th century to select what he thought was the best Greek text) included the verse in his 3rd Edition. From there it found its way into the King James Version (which was based on Erasmus' 3rd Edition \- compare with the Luther Bible, translated from Erasmus’ 2nd Edition, neither of which have this reading). The Trinity doctrine can be (and nearly always is) demonstrated WITHOUT recourse to 1 John 5:7.

    **KJV**: (7) **For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.** (8) And there are three that bear witness **in earth**, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

    **NIV**: (7) For there are three that testify: (8) the Spirit, the water and the blood; and the three are in agreement.

In addition to the above shorter passages, there are two longer passages that are disputed:

**Mark 16:9-20** (UBS4 omits all 12 verses \[A\]) \- assimilated from numerous sources in Matthew, Luke, John and Acts.

(9) Now when Jesus was risen early the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils. (10) And she went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept. (11) And they, when they had heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, believed not. (12) After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked, and went into the country. (13) And they went and told it unto the residue: neither believed they them. (14) Afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat, and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen. (15) And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. (16) He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned. (17) And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; (18) They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover. (19) So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. (20) And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with signs following. Amen.

There are numerous reasons given for why most modern scholars consider these verses to be inauthentic. The general reasons are that the earliest manuscripts and earliest church fathers (up to as late as the 5th Century) don’t include it. Other early manuscripts include the text, but mark it as doubtful. Additionally, it appears to be copied from an early harmony of the Gospels.

There are three primary theories relating to explaining why the verses are missing, and new verses created in their place:

1. Given that Mark’s narrative is abrupt in numerous places, including the beginning, some believe that Mark intended the abrupt ending. This theory states that later scribes included an extended ending cobbled together from the other Gospels.
2. Mark intended to write a longer ending, but was prevented (for unknown reasons) from completing his Gospel and needed to send it to the churches incomplete.
3. Mark originally wrote an ending beyond verse 8, but the original ending was lost at an early date, and its lack was made up for by later writers.

**John 7:53-8:11** (*Pericope Adulterae* \- UBS4 omits entire passage \[A\]) The passage does not introduce any new theology. It is about the forgiveness of sins, a theme which is very clear through the entire New Testament.

The flow of John 7 up through verse 52, then following with 8:12 actually makes a lot of sense and flows much better without the intervening text, indicating that the pericope was inserted.

The earliest evidence for the story actually comes from the apocryphal *Gospel of the Hebrews*. It is quoted by several 2nd Century church fathers as being from that text, while these same writers fail to mention its inclusion in John.

Earliest evidence of being included in John is 4th Century, primarily centered around Rome, and related to translation of the Vulgate. The earliest Greek instance of the passage is in a combined Latin/Greek diglot which is considered highly unreliable because it contains a large number of variant readings. Missing from most Greek manuscripts, as well as from most non-Greek manuscripts. Most early manuscripts that contain it, note its inauthenticity in some manner, either with signs in the text, or commentary, or by moving it to the end of the book of John. Of those that have it, few manuscripts prior to the 8th century contain the passage unmarked.

It is worth noting that the *Gospel of the Hebrews* was well known to Jerome who is credited with authorship of the Vulgate. Jerome spent a significant amount of time among Jewish-Christians for whom the *Gospel of the Hebrews* was considered an important text. One theory is that since the *Gospel of the Hebrews* was excluded as non-canonical, Jerome copied the passage into John to ensure that the story was preserved.

## Further Comments

### **Notes about the Vulgate**

It is often assumed that the Vulgate is a crassly pro-Catholic, corrupted manuscript that was created by a staunchly-Catholic Jerome who created it with Catholic interference to validate or prove Catholic teachings. The truth is, that during the time that Jerome was writing, most of the Catholic errors had not yet entered the church (most Christians were still worshipping on Saturday and baptizing by immersion!).

Plus, Jerome didn’t even write most of the Vulgate. All he did was translate the gospels. The rest of the New Testament books were translated later. The Vulgate didn’t even achieve its modern form until the 1500s.

Additionally, Jerome himself was ejected from Rome for being out of step with the Roman hierarchy\!

Like the original Greek NT manuscripts, Jerome’s original texts are also lost. The earliest available copies are from 200 years after he died, while the earliest complete copies are from another 300 years later.

Like the Greek texts, the Latin texts have numerous variations and inconsistencies so that no two of them are the same.

Additionally, the manuscripts do not follow the Alexandrian/Byzantine issue exactly, although earlier manuscripts more closely conform to Alexandrian readings, and later manuscripts more closely follow Byzantine readings.

It is also worth noting that early Reformers continued to use the Vulgate even after translating scripture into their local languages, as the Vulgate was widely considered the standard text of learning. Luther and many other Reformers used the Vulgate in their writings, and proved their doctrines from the Vulgate rather than from their own local-language scriptures, even when discussing doctrinal issues amongst themselves. The KJV authors made heavy reference to the Vulgate, and in more than 60 places preferred the Vulgate reading over that of the Greek.

### **Notes about KJV**

The KJV is often referred to by KJV-only adherents as the “Authorized” Version as if it were somehow authorized by God.

While it is true that early versions were labelled as authorized, it is good to ask, “authorized by whom?”

The answer is, "Not by God, but by King James II." In fact, in his instructions to the translation committee, King James specifically instructed them to slant the translation to benefit the Church of England so that it could be used to prove CoE doctrines and church structures.

The KJV translators referenced the Latin Vulgate frequently. They even copied two verses directly out of the Douai-Rheims translation of the NT, which was translated entirely from the Latin Vulgate. Additionally, the translators used Latin while discussing the translation work amongst themselves.

## EGW and Bible Version

Ellen White used KJV frequently while speaking, because it was familiar to her listeners, but made liberal use of other translations in her writing. She used some translations that were based on non-Textus Receptus Greek sources, including a translation by Noyes[^1] which is based solely on *Codex Sinaiticus*.[^2]

## Additional Comments

### Basic KJVO Argument

False argument in favor of KJVO:

   > "Most present-day 'evangelical scholars' admit that the King James Version is basically a good translation. But many of them contend that the NASV is better and more accurate. WE REJECT THAT CONCLUSION\! One does not have to be a scholar to know that if you believe in the verbal inspiration and inerrancy of the Scriptures, you cannot have two 'Bibles' (differing in so many places) and still call both of them the Word of God\! We contend that a choice can be made (and should be made) on the basis of a careful comparison of the KJV and NASV texts. Both cannot be reliable and right." M.H. Reynolds, Editor, Foundation Magazine, "The New American Standard Version: Can It Be Trusted?"

### Why that argument is wrong

When you talk about "inerrancy of the scriptures", what makes you assume that "the one" Bible has to be in English? The original texts are in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek \- not English. So the only "inerrant" text would be the original. By that token, KJV is excluded. But since few people know the original languagess, we need the Bible in a language we can read.

   > So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.
   * Romans 10:17 ABT

   > **<sup>8</sup>** For if the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare himself for battle? **<sup>9</sup>** So also with you: unless you utter intelligible speech with the tongue, how will what is spoken be understood? You will be speaking into the air. **<sup>10</sup>** There are, doubtless, many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning. **<sup>11</sup>** But if I do not understand the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.... **<sup>19</sup>** Nevertheless, in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
   * 1 Corinthians 14:8-11, 19

***THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF HAVING A BIBLE IS TO HEAR AND UNDERSTAND THE GOSPEL!*** How can you do that with a translation that is out of date, and uses words that have changed meaning over time? How is the trumpet going to make a clear sound if the trumpet player is using an old trumpet?

If you must make a choice and use only one Bible, then why must it be in English? KJV is, after all, only a translation, and not the original. In the case of the NT, the original would be in Greek, not English. So you cannot in any way claim any kind of inerrancy for KJV. If it has to be English, then how are we going to spread the Gospel to the whole world, most of whom do not know English?

OK, so even if we decide that we're going to use Greek, we have a big problem: we don't have the original Greek text. What we have are a collection of manuscripts that are copies of copies, while most of earliest manuscripts are not complete. Even for the ones that are complete, none of them are in complete agreement with each other. So various methods have been used to come up with a single, standardized Greek text. The names for the texts available today include: Textus Receptus, Majority Text, Critical Text and Byzantine primary. In addition to these, there are several other texts that could theoretically be created: Alexandrian primary, Western primary, Caesarean primary and others. Which one you use depends on your viewpoint and what you consider to be most important.

Textus Receptus (TR), or "Received Text", was the first combined GNT that was created. Many early Bible translations used it, including KJV. It has multiple problems: it does not use any manuscripts earlier than the 12th Century; it uses only Byzantine text-type manuscripts; it uses only a very small number of manuscripts (7 by Erasmus and fewer than 20 more were referenced by later editors); it was created to prove the validity of the Latin Vulgate (or at least Erasmus' edition of the Vulgate); it includes back-translations from the Vulgate; it includes texts that Erasmus deemed invalid but he included them anyway because of pressure from RCC; and others.

   > "The 'Received Text' is also not a single text. It is a tradition of printed texts published during the time of the Protestant Reformation, that is, the 1500's and early 1600's. It includes the editions of Erasmus, Estienne (Stephens), Beza, and Elzevir. These texts are closely allied, and are all mostly derived from Erasmus 1516\. They are based upon a small number of late medieval manuscripts."
   * What about the Majority Text? by Michael D. Marlowe http://www.bible-researcher.com/majority.html

Byzantine primary (Byz) takes the approach that the Byzantine text-type manuscripts are the most correct. The other text-types are only used for comparison or validation. While TR used only Byzantine manuscripts (except for one manuscript that includes Western readings), TR differs significantly from Byz because Byz includes thousands of manuscripts, including many from as early as the 5th Century. In fact, Byz is actually very close to CT.

Majority Text (MT) solves some of the problems of TR in that it includes all available manuscripts, and where manuscripts differ, the reading of the majority is accepted as definitive. Because it follows the majority, and Byz manuscripts are the majority, there are few difference between MT and Byz.

   > "The 'Majority Text' is a statistical construct that does not correspond exactly to any known manuscript. It is arrived at by comparing all known manuscripts with one another and deriving from them the readings that are more numerous than any others."
   * What about the Majority Text? by Michael D. Marlowe http://www.bible-researcher.com/majority.html

Critical Text (CT) attempts to solve the TR problems by also using all available manuscripts, but differs from MT in that it puts greater focus on earlier or more ancient manuscripts. In other words, if there are 100 manuscripts from 10th Century with one reading, and 10 manuscripts from 5th Century with a different reading, then the earlier reading is preferred over the later. Because none of the earliest manuscripts are Byzantine, CT tends to follow the Alexandrian readings because the Alexandrian manuscripts are older.

The fact that KJV came out OK in spite of all of its handicaps testifies to God's leading in spite of man's failings. But that doesn't mean it's a better translation. It has its own problems.

...avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law, because these are unprofitable and useless. \- Titus 3:9 NIV

## More Notes

Mark 16:8-20

John 7:53-8:11

Manuscripts used by Erasmus to create Textus Receptus (TR)

Miniscule 1 (Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 2\)
	Contains entire NT minus book of Revelation
	Gospels are Caesarean text-type, remainder is Byzantine
	12th Century
	While some of its unique variants are present in TR, Erasmus claimed to have not used it much

Miniscule 2814 (Miniscule 1rK)
	Contains entire NT minus last six verses of Revelation
	12th Century
	Gospels are Byzantine text-type, remainder is unclassified
	The only manuscript with Revelation that was used for TR, thus all of Revelation follows this manuscript exactly

Miniscule 2 (Miniscule 2e, Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 1\)
	Gospels only
	11th/12th Century
	Byzantine text-type
	Contains numerous errors and corrections

Miniscule 2815 (Miniscule 2ap, Codex Basilensis A. N. IV. 4\)
	Acts, General epistles, Pauline epistles
	12th Century
	Byzantine text-type
	Erasmus claimed that it was his primary source for the books that it contains

Miniscule 2816 (Miniscule 4ap)
	Acts, General epistles, Pauline epistles (plus Catholic additions)
	15th Century
	Byzantine text-type
	Numerous marginal readings, many of which Erasmus included

Miniscule 7
	Gospels
	12th Century
	Mostly Byzantine text-type, but contains some Alexandrian readings

Miniscule 817
	Gospels
	15th Century
	Mostly Byzantine, but lacking the Pericope Adulterae
	Minor usage by Erasmus, but several of its unique readings are found in TR.

Miniscule 3 (Erasmus included this manuscript when modifying the text for his 2nd edition)
	All of NT except Revelation (also includes Catholic books)
	12th Century
	Omits Pericope Adulterae, but otherwise mostly Byzantine
	Was heavily edited to include variant readings from Vulgate
	Because of all of the changes to make it more like Vulgate, neither mGNT nor Majority Text accept this manuscript as a valid authority.

In addition to the above manuscripts, Erasmus used material back-translated from Latin Vulgate, particularly in Revelation, but also in numerous other locations throughout NT. He also made up a Greek word that exists nowhere else and used that word in Rev 17:4.

It is interesting to note that Erasmus did not include 1 John 5:7 until the 3rd edition of his text. This verse was included in the 3rd edition because of pressure from the Catholic church. They threatened to excommunicate him if he didn’t include it because it was in the Vulgate. The TR wording of 1 John 5:7 is not found in any Greek Manuscript.

Erasmus 3rd Edition 1522 led to Stephanus (Catholic priest) who made four editions. The third edition of 1550 is also known as Editio Regia. For his edition, he took Erasmus' 3rd edition, and edited based on Complutensian Polyglot plus 15 additional Greek MSS. Editio Regia differs from Erasmus 3rd edition in only 284 places. Following this, Theodore Beza (Protestant priest) took the text and modified it further in 9 editions, of which the last was published in 1604\. Although Beza included a few changes, the majority of his work follows Erasmus' 3rd edition very closely. It was the Editio Regia and Beza 1598 editions which were used by KJV editors (although they didn’t translate from Greek, but edited the Bishop’s Bible).

Difference between TR and Majority Text (i.e. \- based solely on Byzantine mss) \= 1,838 changes in the Greek, of which 1,005 are "translatable".

Waldenses: Yes, they had an ancient scriptural manuscript tradition. But it was NOT Greek, but rather a translation from Greek.

"The Waldenses were among the first of the peoples of Europe to obtain a translation of the Holy Scriptures. Hundreds of years before the Reformation they possessed the Bible in manuscript in their native tongue." {GC 65.2}

"Except among the Waldenses, the word of God had for ages been locked up in languages known only to the learned." {GC 79.2}

There are several problems with depending on the Waldenses' scriptures: (1) They're not Greek, and therefore not original; (2) we don't have them any more; (3) there is no direct evidence of when they were created\[1\]; (4) there is no evidence of which text-type was used to create them\[2\]; (5) therefore, it is not possible to compare them to any modern translation, nor use their existence as evidence in support of or opposition to any modern translation.

\[1\] Even though we don't know when they were created, if they existed in the vernacular, then linguistic shift must be taken into account, and we must examine two possibilities: (1) if, as some claim, the Waldenses originally formed in 120AD, and translated their scriptures soon afterwards, then the language they would have spoken at the time would have been Latin, and their translation would have been in Latin, not "Italick", and therefore, they would have had to continually modify their manuscripts to account for language changes over the 1500-year period from 120AD to 1600AD when their "Italick" translations were discovered by the Reformers; or (2) their translations would have been much more recent than 120AD, and therefore would have had to depend on either the Latin Vulgate (though not generally available to the public, they were more widely copied) or more recently-available Greek Manuscripts (mostly preserved in Greek-speaking lands then in the Ottoman Empire, and less widely available to people living in Italy).

\[2\]  At the time of the Waldenses and even beyond the time of Erasmus, the whole issue of text-types wasn't even being talked about. Additionally, nobody did a thorough analysis of the Waldensian scriptures to determine what texts they were similar to. True, there were comments made at the time about "errors in the popish texts", but these were made during a time when Protestants would often vilify and slander anything that had even the slightest connection to RCC as a way of showing Protestant superiority. Such statements must be taken with a grain of salt until the original Waldensian texts can be analyzed.
