# Aramaic Primacy - The Languages of First Century Palestine

## Introduction

For quite a long time, it was generally believed that Aramaic was the sole language of First Century Palestine (1CP). Concurrent with this belief was that Hebrew had died out as a living language by around 400 BC (i.e. - during the time of the Jewish Babylonian Exile). Additionally, it was believed that although Greek had become the lingua-franca of most of the Mediterranean, it had not succeeded in becoming well-known among the Jews by the time that Jesus walked among us.

The foundation for these beliefs was a statement by Josephus that is understood to mean that only Aramaic was spoken by First Century Palestinian Jews. I will deal with Josephus’ statement and what he actually meant in [a separate article](AramaicPrimacy-Josephus.md). But for now I will focus on the language landscape of 1CP.

Because the idea of Aramaic as the only language of the Jews was believed for such a long time by so many experts in the field, it is generally taken for granted by modern audiences who accept it without question. This is particularly true among Aramaic Primacy proponents who use this misconception as a foundation and starting point for their misguided theory.

However... Starting around the 1890s, archaeological discoveries, reviews of documents and artifacts, and extensive research in the topic of the linguistic landscape of 1CP has shed new light on the situation, causing experts in the field to reevaluate commonly-held ideas and revise them based on the new evidence.

Now, I don’t think that there is anyone who doubts the presence of Aramaic in 1CP. All sources that I read indicate that they agree that it was present. And I concur that there is sufficient archaeological and historical evidence to indicate that it was used. The issue at hand, however, is the extent to which it was used, and what other languages, if any, were also commonly used by the Jews in 1CP.

So let’s take a look at Hebrew and Greek to examine the evidence that has come to light regarding the use of these languages in 1CP.

## Hebrew

The first thing that I would like to state here is that everything (or almost everything) that most people think that they know about the Hebrew language as used by the Jews post-Babylonian exile is false.

Up until the 1950s, the general consensus regarding the Hebrew language was that it had died out as a spoken language during the Babylonian exile, and that following the return from Babylon, the Jews had switched entirely to Aramaic as the language of everyday use among the people, with Hebrew only being used for liturgical purposes.

This view is expressed in the 1958 edition of *The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church*, which, under the “Hebrew” article, says that Hebrew “ceased to be a spoken language around the fourth century BCE”.

However, if we fast-forward to the 1997 edition, the same article changed dramatically, stating that Hebrew “continued to be used as a spoken and written language in the New Testament period.”

In fact, researchers are now saying that Hebrew continued as a living language until sometime between 200AD and 400AD.

### Post-Exile Language References in the Old Testament

But doesn’t the Bible mention that the exiles came back from Babylon speaking Aramaic?

Interestingly, no.

This is a misconception. What the Bible actually mentions about the language of the post-exile Jews is in Nehemiah 13:23,24, where some of the returning Jews are shown to have married women from Ashdod (a Philistine city), Ammon and Moab, and that **of their children**, half could speak the language of Ashdod, and of the other half, none could speak the language of Judah, meaning that they spoke either the language of Ammon or Moab. So while these **children of mixed parentage** were speaking the languages of the neighboring countries, none of them was described as speaking Aramaic.

In other words, the Bible only mentions that many of the children of mixed Jewish parentage could not speak Hebrew. Two important points to note her: (1) Nothing is mentioned of the language(s) used by the rest of the population of Israel; and (2) the language that these children spoke is not specified, so there is no reason to assume that it is Aramaic.

Of note in later verses of the Nehemiah 13 passage is that the grandson of the high priest was mentioned as having married the daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, who was a Samaritan. Remember that when the Babylonians conquered Judah and took the Jews into exile, the Samaritans were not taken with the Jews, but continued living in Samaria? **The Samaritans also spoke Hebrew, and continued speaking Hebrew the entire time that the Judeans were gone into the Babylonian captivity**, and were still in Samaria speaking Hebrew when the Jews got back. They also continued speaking Hebrew through the time of Christ and beyond. There are even Samaritans to this day still living in the Holy Land, still speaking their own version of Hebrew.

### Post-Exile Old Testament Books in Hebrew

I would also like to ask how the post-exilic books of the Old Testament canon (Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi) could have been written in Hebrew if that language was already dead. The Hebrew language used in these books shows evidence of having evolved and changed during the intervening exile period, and is not a dry, dusty liturgical language. Rather, these books are written in a prosaic style based on speaking patterns. In other words, the stylisms used in these books shows evidence that Hebrew was still in everyday use by their authors, albeit changed from the earlier Hebrew in that post-exilic Hebrew shows influence of contact with Aramaic.

### The Qumran Scrolls and Bar Kochba Letters

Then, there are the Qumran scrolls which were written about a century before Christ, and mostly in Hebrew, but not in the Hebrew of the Old Testament. Rather, they use a Hebrew that was more like the Hebrew used in the Mishna, and which also showed evidence of being a living, spoken language. In addition, we have the Bar Kochba scrolls, dated to a century after Christ, also primarily written in the same Hebrew as in the Qumran scrolls and the Mishna, further showing that the language was in continuous use throughout that time period.

### Language Changes

The fact that the spoken Hebrew of 1CP was different from Old Hebrew should come as no surprise, as languages have a tendency to change over time, sometimes borrowing words from other languages along the way. The Qumran scrolls and Bar Kochba scrolls are evidence of this. In fact these documents provide a key piece of evidence regarding an apparent contradiction in Matthew 27:46 where Jesus is reported to have said “*Eloi, Eloi lama sabachthani*.”

The problem with this phrase is that the words *eloi* and *lama* are **Hebrew words** with no similarity to any Aramaic equivalent; while *sabachthani* appears to be Aramaic. However, the Mishna as well as Qumran and Bar Kochba scrolls show that the root word for *sabachthani* had been borrowed into Hebrew from Aramaic and was considered a native Hebrew word by the First Century. Thus, Jesus’ utterance on the cross, as recorded by Matthew, would be considered correct Hebrew to his listeners.

One further item is worth bringing up: while there are some Aramaic Primacists who try to claim that it was forbidden to use Greek in the Temple of Jerusalem during the time of Christ, and therefore Aramaic had to have been required, this is a fallacy. Yes, it is true that Greek was forbidden. But so was Aramaic... and every other language besides Hebrew. It was Hebrew, and not Aramaic, that was required to be used in the Temple. In which case, Jesus must have been able to speak Hebrew, since the New Testament shows Him speaking in the temple on multiple occasions, including when he was twelve. And if he had such excellent command of the language that he was able to dispute with the teachers of the law when he was twelve years old, this means that **he had to have grown up speaking Hebrew.**

## Greek

So now, let’s take a look at Greek, and the evidence that has come to light regarding its use in 1CP.

How likely is it that three independent witnesses would make the same translations from Aramaic into Greek?

"Inscriptions and texts show the predominance of Greek throughout the region \[of Syria\]. Greek was not confined to the cities, as inscriptions, papyrus and parchments from rural settings show."  
Butcher, Kevin. Roman Syria and the Near East. p. 284\.  
"Syriac inscriptions are found in Mesopotamia during the early \[Roman\] empire, and the Euphrates archive shows that it could also be used for legal documents, but there are no Syriac inscriptions known in Syria proper until the late fourth century. This epigraphic evidence fits with what is known of Syriac literature \- only in the fifth century do we find Syriac writers from regions west of the Euphrates..."  
Butcher, Kevin. Roman Syria and the Near East. p. 286\.  
"While there is plenty of evidence for the use of Phoenician in Hellenistic times (in contrast to the paucity of evidence for Aramaic in this period), all the evidence suggests that by the beginning of the first century AD, it had been supplanted by Greek."
