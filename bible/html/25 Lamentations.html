    <h1>The Lamentations of Jeremiah</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;How lonely sits the city that was full of people!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has become like a widow, she who was great among the nations!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She who was a princess among the provinces has become a slave.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;She weeps bitterly in the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her tears are on her cheeks;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among all her lovers there is none to comfort her.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her friends have dealt treacherously with her;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have become her enemies.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Judah has gone into exile under affliction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under harsh servitude;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she dwells among the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but finds no rest.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her pursuers have overtaken her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the midst of distress.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The roads of Zion mourn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because none come to the appointed feasts;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all her gates are desolate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her priests groan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her virgins grieve,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she herself is bitter.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Her adversaries have become her masters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her enemies prosper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the LORD has afflicted her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the multitude of her transgressions;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her little ones have gone away captive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the foe.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;From the daughter of Zion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all her splendor has departed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her princes have become like deer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that find no pasture;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fled without strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the pursuer.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;In the days of her affliction and wandering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem remembers all her precious things<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that were from the days of old.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When her people fell into the hand of the enemy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no one helped her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the adversaries saw her and mocked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at her downfall.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Jerusalem has grievously sinned;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore she has become unclean.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who honored her despise her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they have seen her nakedness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she herself groans<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and turns away.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Her uncleanness was in her skirts;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she did not consider her latter end.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore she has fallen astonishingly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she has no comforter.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“See, O LORD, my affliction,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the enemy has magnified himself.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;The adversary has stretched out his hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over all her precious things;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for she has seen the nations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enter her sanctuary,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those whom You commanded<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they should not enter Your assembly.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;All her people groan<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they search for bread;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have given their precious things for food<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to restore their lives.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“See, O LORD, and look,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I am despised.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;“Is it nothing to you, all who pass by?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which has been brought upon me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which the LORD inflicted<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of His fierce anger.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;From on high He sent fire into my bones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it prevailed against them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has spread a net for my feet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has turned me back;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made me desolate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and faint all the day long.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The yoke of my transgressions is bound by His hand;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are knit together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have come up upon my neck;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made my strength fail.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord has given me into the hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those whom I cannot withstand.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The Lord has rejected<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all my mighty men in my midst;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has called an assembly against me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to crush my young men.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lord has trodden as in a winepress<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the virgin daughter of Judah.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For these things I weep;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my eyes flow with tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a comforter is far from me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one to restore my life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My children are desolate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the enemy has prevailed.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Zion stretches out her hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but there is no one to comfort her;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD has commanded against Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that his neighbors should be his adversaries;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerusalem has become<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an unclean thing among them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;“The LORD is righteous,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I have rebelled against His commandment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hear, all peoples, and see my sorrow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my virgins and my young men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have gone into captivity.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;I called to my lovers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they deceived me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my priests and my elders perished in the city<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while they sought food for themselves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to restore their lives.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;See, O LORD, for I am in distress;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my spirit is greatly troubled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart is overturned within me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I have been very rebellious.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the street the sword bereaves;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the house it is like death.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;They have heard that I sigh;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is none to comfort me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All my enemies have heard of my trouble;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are glad that You have done it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring the day that You have proclaimed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they may become like me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Let all their wickedness come before You,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and deal with them as You have dealt with me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all my transgressions;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for my sighs are many,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my heart is faint.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;How the Lord in His anger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has cast down from heaven to earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the splendor of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has not remembered His footstool<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of His anger.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The Lord has swallowed up without mercy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the habitations of Jacob;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has torn down in His wrath the strongholds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the daughter of Judah;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has brought them down to the ground;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has profaned the kingdom and its princes.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;In fierce anger He has cut off<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every horn of Israel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has withdrawn His right hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from before the enemy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has burned against Jacob like a flaming fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consuming all around.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He has bent His bow like an enemy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has set His right hand like an adversary<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and slain all that were pleasant to the eye;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the tent of the daughter of Zion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has poured out His fury like fire.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The Lord has become like an enemy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has swallowed up Israel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has swallowed up all her palaces;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has destroyed her strongholds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and multiplied in the daughter of Judah<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mourning and lamentation.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He has violently treated His tabernacle like a garden hut;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has destroyed His appointed meeting place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD has caused the appointed feast and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in the indignation of His anger has despised king and priest.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The Lord has rejected His altar;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has abandoned His sanctuary;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has delivered into the hand of the enemy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the walls of her palaces.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have raised a cry in the house of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as on the day of an appointed feast.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The LORD determined to destroy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wall of the daughter of Zion;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stretched out the measuring line;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He did not withdraw His hand from destroying;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made rampart and wall lament;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they languish together.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Her gates have sunk into the ground;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has destroyed and broken her bars;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her king and her princes are among the nations;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the law is no more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and her prophets find no vision from the LORD.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;The elders of the daughter of Zion sit on the ground and keep silence;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have thrown dust on their heads;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have girded themselves with sackcloth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;My eyes fail because of tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my spirit is troubled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart is poured out on the ground<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the destruction of the daughter of my people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the little ones and infants faint<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the streets of the city.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;They say to their mothers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Where is grain and wine?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they faint like wounded men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the streets of the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as their life is poured out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on their mothers’ bosom.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;What can I say for you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I compare to you, O daughter of Jerusalem?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can I liken to you that I may comfort you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O virgin daughter of Zion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your ruin is vast as the sea;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who can heal you?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Your prophets have seen for you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;vain and foolish things;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have not exposed your iniquity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to restore your fortunes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but have seen for you oracles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of falsehood and delusion.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;All who pass along the way clap their hands at you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they hiss and shake their heads<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Is this the city that was called<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the perfection of beauty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the joy of the whole earth?”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;All your enemies open their mouths wide against you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they hiss and gnash their teeth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“We have swallowed her up!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely this is the day we have waited for;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have found it, we have seen it.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;The LORD has done what He purposed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has carried out His word<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which He commanded from days of old;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has thrown down without pity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has caused the enemy to rejoice over you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has exalted the horn of your adversaries.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Their heart cried out to the Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“O wall of the daughter of Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let tears run down like a river day and night;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give yourself no relief;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let not the apple of your eye cease.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;“Arise, cry out in the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the beginning of the watches;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pour out your heart like water<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the face of the Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lift up your hands toward Him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the life of your little ones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who faint for hunger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the head of every street.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;“Look, O LORD, and consider<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to whom You have done this!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should women eat the fruit of their womb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children they have cared for?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should priest and prophet be slain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the sanctuary of the Lord?”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;The young and the old<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lie on the ground in the streets;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my virgins and my young men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have fallen by the sword;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have slain them in the day of Your anger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have slaughtered without pity.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;You have summoned as on an appointed day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my terrors on every side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there was no one who escaped or survived<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the day of the LORD’s anger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those whom I have cared for and raised,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my enemy has destroyed.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I am the man who has seen affliction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the rod of His wrath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He has driven me and brought me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into darkness and not light.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Surely against me He turns His hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;again and again all the day.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He has worn away my flesh and my skin;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has broken my bones.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;He has besieged me and surrounded me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with bitterness and hardship.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He has made me dwell in dark places<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like those long dead.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He has walled me in so I cannot escape;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made my chains heavy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Even when I cry out and call for help,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shuts out my prayer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He has blocked my ways with hewn stone;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made my paths crooked.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;He is to me like a bear lying in wait,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a lion in hiding.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He has turned aside my ways and torn me in pieces;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made me desolate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;He has bent His bow and set me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the target for His arrow.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;He has caused the arrows of His quiver<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to pierce my inward parts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I have become the laughingstock of all my people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their song all the day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;He has filled me with bitterness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has made me drunk with wormwood.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;He has broken my teeth with gravel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has covered me with ashes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;My soul has been removed from peace;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have forgotten what prosperity is.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;So I said, “My strength is gone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my hope from the LORD.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Remember my affliction and my wandering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wormwood and the gall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;My soul continually remembers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and is bowed down within me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Yet this I call to mind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and therefore I have hope:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The LORD’s loyal love never ceases;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His compassions never fail.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;They are new every morning;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;great is Your faithfulness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;“The LORD is my portion,” says my soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“therefore I will hope in Him.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;The LORD is good to those who wait for Him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the soul who seeks Him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;It is good that one should wait quietly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the salvation of the LORD.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;It is good for a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to bear the yoke in his youth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Let him sit alone and be silent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because He has laid it on him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Let him put his mouth in the dust—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps there is hope.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Let him give his cheek to the one who strikes him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him be filled with reproach.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;For the Lord will not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reject forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Though He causes grief, He will have compassion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the abundance of His steadfast love.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;For He does not willingly afflict<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or grieve the sons of man.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;To crush underfoot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all the prisoners of the earth,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;to deny a man justice<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of the Most High,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;to subvert a man in his cause—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord does not approve.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;Who is there who speaks and it happens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unless the Lord has commanded it?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;Is it not from the mouth of the Most High<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that both calamities and blessings come?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Why should any living man comlain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;Let us test and examine our ways,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and return to the LORD.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;Let us lift up our hearts and hands<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to God in heaven:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;“We have transgressed and rebelled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and You have not pardoned.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;You have wrapped Yourself in anger and pursued us;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have slain without pity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;You have covered Yourself with a cloud<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that no prayer can pass through.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;You have made us scum and refuse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among the nations.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;All our enemies have opened their mouths<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against us.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;Terror and pitfall have come upon us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devastation and destruction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;My eyes flow with streams of tears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;My eyes flow unceasingly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without relief,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;until the LORD looks down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sees from heaven.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;My eyes bring pain to my soul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of all the daughters of my city.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;My enemies without cause<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hunted me down like a bird.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>53</sup>&nbsp;They silenced my life in the pit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cast stones on me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;Waters flowed over my head;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said, “I am cut off.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;I called on Your name, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the lowest pit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>56</sup>&nbsp;You heard my voice:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Do not close Your ear to my cry for relief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to my cry for help.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>57</sup>&nbsp;You drew near when I called on You;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said, “Do not fear.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>58</sup>&nbsp;You have pleaded the causes of my soul, O Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have redeemed my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>59</sup>&nbsp;You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge my cause.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>60</sup>&nbsp;You have seen all their vengeance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all their plots against me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>61</sup>&nbsp;You have heard their reproach, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all their schemes against me,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>62</sup>&nbsp;the lips of my enemies and their whispering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are against me all day long.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>63</sup>&nbsp;Look at their sitting down and their rising up;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am their song.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>64</sup>&nbsp;You will repay them, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the work of their hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>65</sup>&nbsp;You will give them hardness of heart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your curse will be on them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>66</sup>&nbsp;You will pursue them in anger and destroy them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from under the heavens of the LORD.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;How the gold has grown dim,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fine gold changed!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacred stones lie scattered<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at every street corner.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The precious sons of Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;worth their weight in pure gold—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how they are reckoned as clay jars,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the work of a potter’s hands!</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Even jackals offer the breast<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to nurse their young,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the daughter of my people has become cruel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like ostriches in the wilderness.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The tongue of the nursing infant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sticks to its palate for thirst;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children beg for bread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but no one breaks it for them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Those who once feasted on delicacies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lie dying in the streets;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who were brought up in scarlet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now embrace ash heaps.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;The guilt of the daughter of my people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is greater than the sin of Sodom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which was overthrown in a moment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no hands were laid on her.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Her princes were purer than snow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whiter than milk;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their bodies were more ruddy than coral,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their form like sapphire.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Now their appearance is darker than soot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are not recognized in the streets.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their skin has shriveled on their bones;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it has become dry as wood.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Those slain by the sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were better off than those slain by hunger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who waste away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pierced through for lack of the fruits of the field.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;The hands of compassionate women<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have boiled their own children;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they became their food<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The LORD has spent His fury;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has poured out His fierce anger.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He kindled a fire in Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it consumed her foundations.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The kings of the earth did not believe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor any of the inhabitants of the world,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that foe or enemy could enter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;It was because of the sins of her prophets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the iniquities of her priests,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who shed in her midst<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blood of the righteous.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;They wandered, blind, through the streets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defiled with blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that none could touch<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their garments.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;“Away! Unclean!” they cried to them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Away! Away! Do not touch!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they fled and wandered;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it was said among the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They shall dwell here no longer.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The LORD Himself has scattered them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He no longer regards them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did not honor the priests;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they showed no favor to the elders.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Still our eyes failed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;watching vainly for help.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We watched and watched<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a nation that could not save.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;They hunted our steps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that we could not walk in our streets.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our end drew near; our days were finished,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for our end had come.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Our pursuers were swifter<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than the eagles of the sky.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They chased us on the mountains;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;The breath of our nostrils,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD’s anointed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was captured in their pits—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he of whom we said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Rejoice and be glad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O daughter of Edom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you who dwell in the land of Uz!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to you also the cup shall pass;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The punishment of your iniquity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O daughter of Zion, is accomplished;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will no longer exile you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But He will punish your iniquity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O daughter of Edom;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will expose your sins.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Remember, O LORD, what has come upon us;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look and see our disgrace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our houses to foreigners.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;We have become orphans, fatherless;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our mothers are like widows.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;We must pay for the water we drink;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our wood comes at a price.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;We are pursued with a yoke on our necks;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are weary, we find no rest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;We have given our hand to Egypt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to Assyria, to get enough bread.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Our fathers sinned and are no more,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but we bear their iniquities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Servants rule over us;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is none to deliver us from their hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;We get our bread at the peril of our lives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the sword in the wilderness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Our skin burns like an oven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the scorching heat of famine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;They ravished the women in Zion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the virgins in the towns of Judah.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Princes were hung up by their hands;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no respect was shown to the elders.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Young men were made to grind at the mill,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and boys staggered under loads of wood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The elders have left the gate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the young men their music.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The joy of our hearts has ceased;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our dance has turned into mourning.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The crown has fallen from our head;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;woe to us, for we have sinned!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Because of this our heart is faint;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of these things our eyes grow dim,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;because Mount Zion lies desolate;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foxes prowl over it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;You, O LORD, reign forever;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your throne endures from generation to generation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Why do You forget us forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why do You forsake us so long?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Restore us to Yourself, O LORD, that we may return;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renew our days as of old—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;unless You have utterly rejected us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are exceedingly angry with us.<br></p>
