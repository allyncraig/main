    <h1>The Gospel According to Mark</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;As it is written in Isaiah the prophet: “Look, I am sending My messenger ahead of you, who will prepare Your way,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;a voice of one calling out in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the LORD, make His paths straight.’”[Exodus 23:20, Malachi 3:1, Isaiah 40:3]&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him to be baptized by him in the Jordan River, and to confess their sins.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;John was clothed with camel’s hair and wore a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He preached, saying, “After me comes One who is mightier than I, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to bend down and untie.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I am baptizing you with water, but He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;In those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan river.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;As He was coming up out of the water, He saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on Him like a dove.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And a voice came from heaven: “You are My beloved Son; I am very pleased with You.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Immediately the Spirit drove Him out into the wilderness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;He was in the wilderness for forty days, being tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels were serving Him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;After John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the Good News of God,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;and saying, “The time has been fulfilled [Daniel 9:24-26], and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the Good News!”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;As He was passing along by the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “Come. Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Immediately they left their nets and followed Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Going on a little farther, He saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;At once He called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers and followed Him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Then they went to Capernaum, and as soon as it was the Sabbath, He entered the synagogue and began teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The people were astonished at His teaching, for He taught them as one having authority, and not like the scribes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;At that time, a man with an unclean spirit was in their synagogue, and He cried out,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;saying, “What do You have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;When the unclean spirit came out of him, it convulsed the man, who cried out with a loud voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;They were all amazed, so they began discussing among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands unclean spirits, and they obey Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;At once His fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;After leaving the synagogue, they went with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and they immediately told Him about her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;So He came, took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she began to serve them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;That evening, after sunset, all who were sick or oppressed by demons were brought to Him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;so that he whole town was gathered at the door,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;and He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But He would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew Him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, He got up, left the house, and went off to a deserted place, where He was praying.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;Simon and the others with him searched for Him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;and when they found Him, they said to Him, “Everyone is looking for You.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;He said to them, “Let’s go somewhere else—to the other villages in the area—so I can preach there too, for that is why I came.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;And He went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;A man with leprosy came to Him, begging and kneeling, and said to Him, “If you are willing, You can make me clean.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out His hand, touched him, and said to him, “I am willing; be clean.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Immediately the leprosy left him, and He was made clean.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;Jesus sternly warned him and sent him away at once,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;saying to him, “See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifice commanded by Moses for your cleansing [Leviticus 14:1-32], as a testimony to them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;But the man went out and began to proclaim it freely and spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town but stayed out in deserted places. Even then, people kept coming to Him from everywhere.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;After a few days, Jesus returned to Capernaum, and word spread that He was at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;A large crowd gathered, so much so that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and He began teaching them the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Some people came bringing a paralyzed man to Him, carried by four men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Since they couldn’t get close to Jesus because of the crowd, they removed the roof above where He was. After digging through it, they lowered the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Now, some of the scribes were sitting there, reasoning in their hearts,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;“Why does this man speak like this? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins except God alone?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Immediately, Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were thinking this way to themselves, said to them, “Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Which is easier: to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, pick up your mat, and walk’?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;But, so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—He said to the paralyzed man,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;“I tell you, get up, take your mat, and go home.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And He got up, immediately picked up his mat, and went out in front of everyone. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We’ve never seen anything like this!”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Jesus went out again beside the sea, and the whole crowd came to Him, and He taught them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;As He passed by, He saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at a tax booth, and He said to him, “Follow me.” And Levi got up and followed him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Later, Jesus was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, and many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Him and His disciples—for there were many who followed Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;When the scribes of the Pharisees saw that He was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to His disciples, “Why does He eat with tax collectors and sinners?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It’s not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I didn’t come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and some people came and asked Him, “Why do John’s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Jesus replied to them, “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can’t fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the new patch pulls away from the old, and the tear becomes worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wine bursts the skins, and both the wine and the skins are ruined. No, new wine goes into fresh wineskins.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;One Sabbath, Jesus was passing through the grainfields, and his disciples began to pluck heads of grain as they walked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;The Pharisees said to Him, “Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;He responded to them, “Haven’t you ever read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;How he entered the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the Presence, which isn’t lawful for anyone to eat except the priests, and he also gave some to those who were with him?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Then He said to them, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;So the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Jesus entered the synagogue again, and a man was there with a withered hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Some people were watching Him closely to see if He would heal the man on the Sabbath, so they could accuse Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up in the middle of everyone.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Then He asked them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do harm, to save a life or to kill?” But they remained silent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man stretched it out, and his hand was restored.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;The Pharisees went out immediately and began plotting with the Herodians against Him, discussing how they might destroy Him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, and a large crowd followed Him from Galilee, Judea,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan river, and the region around Tyre and Sidon. They came to Him because they heard about everything He was doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He told his disciples to have a small boat ready for Him because of the crowd, so they wouldn’t crush Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For He had healed many, and as a result, all those who had diseases were pressing in on Him to touch Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Whenever the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and shouted, “You are the Son of God!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;But He sternly warned them not to make Him known.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Jesus went up on the mountain and called to Himself those He wanted, and they came to Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;He appointed twelve, whom He also named apostles, to be with Him and to send them out to preach&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;and to have authority to cast out demons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom He gave the name Peter),&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;James the son of Zebedee and John his brother (to whom He gave the name Boanerges, which means “Sons of Thunder”),&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Then He went into a house, and the crowd gathered again, so that they couldn’t even eat a meal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;When His family heard about it, they went out to take hold of Him, for they were saying, “He’s out of His mind.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, “He’s possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “He casts out demons by the ruler of the demons.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;So He called them over and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, He cannot stand, but his end has come.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;No one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Truly I tell you, all sins will be forgiven the children of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;He said this because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Then His mother and His brothers arrived, standing outside. They sent word to Him, calling for Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;A crowd was sitting around Him, and they said to Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are outside looking for You.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;He answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Looking around at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are my mother and my brothers!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Once again, Jesus began teaching beside the sea. A massive crowd gathered around Him, so He climbed into a boat and sat down while the entire crowd remained on the shore by the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He taught them many things through parables, and in His teaching, He said to them:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;"Listen! A farmer went out to sow his seed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;As he was scattering it, some seed fell along the path, and the birds swooped down and ate it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Other seed fell on rocky ground where there wasn’t much soil. It sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;but when the sun came up, it scorched the plants, and since they had no deep roots, they withered away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Some seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it out, so it produced nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But other seed fell on good soil and yielded a crop, growing up and increasing—some producing thirty times, some sixty, and some a hundred times what was sown."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Then He added, "Whoever has ears to hear, let them listen."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;When He was alone, those around him, along with the Twelve, asked him about the parables.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He told them, "The mystery of God’s kingdom has been entrusted to you. But to those outside, everything comes in parables,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;so that ‘they may look and look but not perceive, and hear and hear but not understand, lest they turn and be forgiven.’"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Then He said to them, "Don’t you get this parable? How will you understand any of the parables?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The farmer sows the word.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Some people are like the seed along the path—where the word is sown, Satan comes right away and snatches it up before it can take root.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Others are like the seed sown on rocky ground—they hear the word and immediately accept it with joy,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;but they don’t have deep roots. They last for a little while, but when trouble or persecution hits because of the word, they fall away fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Then there are those like the seed sown among thorns—they hear the word,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;but the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and cravings for other things creep in and choke it out, leaving it fruitless.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;But those like the seed sown on good soil—they hear the word, welcome it, and produce a harvest: some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred times what was sown."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;He went on to say to them, "Do you bring a lamp just to stick it under a basket or under the bed? No, you put it on a stand, right?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Because nothing is hidden that won’t be brought to light, and nothing is secret that won’t come out into the open.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;If anyone has ears to hear, let them listen."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Then He added, "Pay attention to what you hear. The measure that you use, and even more, will be the measure used for what you receive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;So whoever has much will receive more; but whoever has little, even what they think they have will be taken away."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;He also said, "The kingdom of God is like this: a man scatters seed on the ground,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;and he sleeps and wakes, night and day, while the seed sprouts and grows—he doesn’t even know how—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;the earth produces it all on its own. First the stalk appears, then the head, then the full grain in the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;And when the crop is ready, he grabs the sickle right away, because harvest time has come."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;He continued, "What can we compare the kingdom of God to, or what parable should we use for it?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;It’s like a mustard seed, which, when sown in the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;But once it’s planted, it grows up and becomes the largest of all garden plants, with branches so big that the birds of the air can nest in its shade."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;With many parables like these, He spoke the word to them, as much as they could handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;He didn’t say anything to them without using a parable, but when He was alone with His own disciples, He explained everything.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;That same day, when evening came, He said to them, "Let’s cross over to the other side."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;Leaving the crowd behind, they took Him along in the boat, just as He was, and other boats were with Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;A fierce windstorm kicked up, and waves started crashing into the boat, so it was already filling with water.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;But Jesus was in the stern, asleep on a cushion. They woke Him up, shouting, "Teacher, don’t You care that we’re about to die?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;He got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Quiet! Be still!" At this, the wind died down, and there was a great calm.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;Then He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? Don’t you have any faith yet?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;They were overwhelmed with awe and said to each other, "Who is this? Even the wind and the sea obey Him!"</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;After this, they landed on the other side of the sea, in the region of the Gerasenes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And when He stepped out of the boat, immediately a man from the tombs with an unclean spirit met Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He had his dwelling among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains were torn apart by him, and the shackles were smashed, and no one had the strength to subdue him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;And night and day, among the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before Him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For He was saying to him, “Come out of the man, unclean spirit!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;And He asked him, “What is your name?” And he said to Him, “My name is Legion, for we are many.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And he begged Him earnestly not to send them out of the region.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Now at that place, near the mountain, a large herd of pigs was feeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And they begged Him, saying, “Send us into the pigs, that we may enter them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And He permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs, and the herd—about two thousand in number—rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And those who were feeding them fled and reported it in the city and in the countryside. And they came to see what had happened.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting, clothed, and in his right mind—the one who had the Legion—and they were afraid.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and about the pigs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And they began to beg him to depart from their region.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And as He was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed was begging him that He might be with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;And He did not allow him, but said to him, “Go to your home, to your own people, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He had mercy on you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;And He went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;And when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and He was by the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;And one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came, and seeing him, He fell at his feet&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;and begged him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, that she may be healed and live.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;And He went with him. And a large crowd followed him and pressed around him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;And a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;and had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was not helped at all but rather grew worse,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;having heard about Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I will be healed.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;And immediately the flow of her blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my garments?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, and you say, ‘Who touched me?’”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;And He looked around to see the woman who had done this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;And He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be free from your affliction.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;While He was still speaking, some came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher any further?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;But Jesus, overhearing the word being spoken, said to the synagogue ruler, “Do not fear, only believe.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;And He allowed no one to follow him except Peter, James and John, the brother of James.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;And they came to the house of the synagogue ruler, and He saw a commotion, and people weeping and wailing loudly.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;And entering, He said to them, “Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child has not died but is sleeping.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;And they laughed at him. But He, having put them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;And taking the hand of the child, He said to her, “Talitha koum,” which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, arise.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;And immediately the little girl got up and began walking—she was twelve years old—and they were immediately overcome with great amazement.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;And He strictly charged them that no one should know this, and He told them to give her something to eat.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And He went out from there and came into his hometown, and his disciples followed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And when the Sabbath came, He began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did this man get these things, and what is this wisdom given to him, and how are such mighty works done by his hands?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they took offense at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;And He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid his hands on a few sick men and healed them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And He marveled because of their unbelief. And He went around among the villages teaching.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And He called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and He gave them authority over unclean spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;And He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in their belts—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And He said to them, “Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And they went out and proclaimed that men should repent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And King Herod heard of it, for Jesus’ name had become known, and He said, “John the Baptist has been raised from the dead, and that is why these mighty works are at work in him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;But others said, “He is Elijah.” And others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;But when Herod heard it, He said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For Herod himself had sent and seized John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because He had married her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death, but she could not,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;because Herod feared John, knowing that He was a righteous and holy man, and He kept him safe. When He heard him, He was greatly perplexed, and yet He heard him gladly.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;But an opportunity came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;When Herodias’s daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining with him. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;And He swore to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;And she went out and said to her mother, “What shall I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests, He did not want to refuse her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;And immediately the king sent an executioner and ordered him to bring his head. And He went and beheaded him in the prison,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And the apostles gathered together with Jesus and reported to him all that they had done and taught.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;And He said to them, “Come away by yourselves to an unfrequented place and rest a while.” For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;And they went away in the boat to an unfrequented place by themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;And when He went ashore, He saw a great crowd, and He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And He began to teach them many things.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, “This is a remote place, and the hour is now late.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;But He answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;And He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” And when they found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Then He commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;And they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;And taking the five loaves and the two fish, He looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. And He divided the two fish among them all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;And they all ate and were satisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;And immediately He made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while He dismissed the crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;And after He had taken leave of them, He went up on the mountain to pray.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and He was alone on the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;And He saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night He came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;but when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and cried out,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately He spoke to them and said, “Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;And He got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>53</sup>&nbsp;And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;And when they got out of the boat, the men immediately recognized him&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick on their beds to wherever they heard He was.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>56</sup>&nbsp;And wherever He came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And they saw that some of his disciples were eating bread with unclean hands, that is, unwashed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands carefully, holding to the tradition of the elders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they cleanse themselves. And there are many other things they have received to observe: the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze vessels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unclean hands?”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;But He said to them, “Isaiah prophesied rightly about you hypocrites, as it is written: ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;And He said to them, “You skillfully set aside the commandment of God in order to keep your tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is Corban”’ (that is, a gift devoted to God),&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;nullifying the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many such things like this.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And calling the crowd to him again, He said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;There is nothing outside a man that enters into him that can defile him, but the things that come out of a man are what defile him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;[Early manuscripts do not contain this verse]&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And when He entered a house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And He said to them, “Are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever enters a man from outside cannot defile him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;because it does not enter his heart but his stomach, and then goes out into the latrine, digesting all foods?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;And He said, “What comes out of a man, that is what defiles him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;greed, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;All these evil things come from within and defile a man.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;And from there He arose and went away to the region of Tyre. And entering a house, He wanted no one to know, yet He could not escape notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;But immediately a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit heard about him and came and fell at his feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she kept asking him to cast the demon out of her daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;And He said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not good to take the bread of the children and throw it to the dogs.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;But she answered and said to him, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat the crumbs of the children.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;And He said to her, “Because of this answer, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And going back to her home, she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;And again, departing from the region of Tyre, He came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the region of the Decapolis.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they begged him to lay his hand on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;And taking him aside from the crowd privately, He put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, He touched his tongue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;And looking up to heaven, He sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha,” that is, “Be opened.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and He spoke plainly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;And He ordered them to tell no one, but the more He ordered them, the more exceedingly they proclaimed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;And they were utterly astonished, saying, “He has done all things well; He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In those days, when a large crowd had gathered again and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to him and said to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;“I have compassion on the crowd because they have already stayed with me for three days and have nothing to eat.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;If I send them away to their homes hungry, they will faint on the way, and some of them have come from far off.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;His disciples answered him, “Where can anyone get enough bread here in this desolate place to feed these men?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;He asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves and giving thanks, He broke them and gave them to his disciples to distribute, and they distributed them to the crowd.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;They also had a few small fish. After blessing them, He said to distribute these as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;They ate and were satisfied, and they picked up seven baskets full of the leftover pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;There were about four thousand men present. Then He sent them away.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Immediately He got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The Pharisees came out and began to argue with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven to test him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Sighing deeply in his spirit, He said, “Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Leaving them, He got into the boat again and went to the other side.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The disciples had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;He cautioned them, saying, “Watch out—beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;They began discussing with one another that they had no bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Aware of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They said to him, “Twelve.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;“And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They said, “Seven.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;He said to them, “Do you not yet understand?”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;They came to Bethsaida. Some men brought a blind man to him and begged him to touch him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Taking the blind man by the hand, He led him outside the village. After spitting on his eyes and laying his hands on him, He asked him, “Do you see anything?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;He looked up and said, “I see men, but they look like trees walking around.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Then He laid his hands on his eyes again, and He saw clearly; He was restored and saw everything distinctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Jesus sent him to his home, saying, “Do not even enter the village.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Jesus went out with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way, He asked his disciples, “Who do men say that I am?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;They answered him, “John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and others, one of the prophets.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;He asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered him, “You are the Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;He strictly charged them to tell no one about him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;He began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things, be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and scribes, be killed, and after three days rise again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;He spoke this word openly. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;But turning and looking at his disciples, He rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Calling the crowd to him along with his disciples, He said to them, “If any man wants to come after me, let him deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel’s will save it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;For whoever is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him when He comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And He said to them, "Truly I say to you that there are some of those standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God having come in power."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And after six days, Jesus took Peter, James and John and led them up to a high mountain by themselves, alone. And He was transfigured before them,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;and his garments became radiant, exceedingly white, such as no launderer on earth could whiten them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And Elijah appeared to them with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;And Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For He did not know what to say, because they were terrified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud: "This is my beloved Son; listen to him."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus alone.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;And as they were coming down from the mountain, He ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And they kept the matter to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead might mean.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And they asked him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And He said to them, "Elijah does come first and restores all things. And how is it written about the Son of Man, that He should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And when they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And immediately, when the whole crowd saw him, they were greatly amazed and ran up to greet him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;And He asked them, "What are you arguing about with them?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And one from the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you, who has a mute spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. And I told your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;And answering them, He said, "O faithless generation, how long will I be with you? How long will I endure you? Bring him to me."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;And they brought him to him. And when the spirit saw him, it immediately convulsed the boy, and He fell on the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;And He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" And He said, "From childhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;And many times it has thrown him into fire and into water to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, "If you can? All things are possible for the one who believes."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;And when Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;And after crying out and convulsing him greatly, it came out. And the boy became like a corpse, so that many said, "He is dead."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him up, and He stood up.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;And when He had entered a house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;And He said to them, "This kind cannot come out by anything except prayer."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And leaving there, they passed through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;for He was teaching his disciples and saying to them, "The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him, and after being killed, He will rise after three days."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;And they came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house, He asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;But they were silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;And sitting down, He called the twelve and said to them, "If anyone wants to be first, He must be last of all and servant of all."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;And taking a child, He set him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, He said to them,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;"Whoever receives one of these children in my name receives me, and whoever receives me does not receive me but the one who sent me."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;John said to him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because He was not following us."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;But Jesus said, "Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;For the one who is not against us is for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you bear the name of Christ, truly I say to you, He will not lose his reward.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;"And whoever causes one of these little ones who believes in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and He were thrown into the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;And if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;[]&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;[]&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;And if your eye causes you to stumble, tear it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;For everyone will be salted with fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;Salt is good, but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now rising up from there, He comes into the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gather to him again. As was his custom, He began teaching them once more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Some Pharisees approached and asked him, testing him, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He answered them, “What did Moses command you?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;They said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “Because of the hardness of your hearts, He wrote this commandment for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;‘For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;and the two will become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two, but one flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, what God has joined together, let no man separate.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Later, in the house, his disciples asked him again about this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He said to them, “Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Then they brought little children to him so He might touch them, but the disciples rebuked those who brought them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;When Jesus saw this, He was indignant and said to them, “Let the little children come to me; do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;And taking them in his arms, He blessed them, laying his hands on them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;As He was setting out on a journey, a man ran up, knelt before him, and asked, “Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;You know the commandments: ‘Do not murder, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;He said to him, “Teacher, I have kept all these from my youth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, “One thing you lack: go, sell what you have, give it to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;But at this word, He became gloomy and went away sorrowful, for He had many possessions.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;The disciples were amazed at his words, but Jesus spoke again and said, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;They were exceedingly astonished and said to one another, “Then who can be saved?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Looking at them, Jesus said, “With man it is impossible, but not with God, for all things are possible with God.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Peter began to say to him, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the gospel’s sake,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;They were on the road going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. They were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. Taking the twelve aside again, He began to tell them what was going to happen to him:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;“See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death and hand him over to the Gentiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;They will mock him, spit on him, flog him, and kill him, and after three days He will rise.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;He said to them, “What do you want me to do for you?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;They said to him, “Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking. Can you drink the cup that I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;They said to him, “We can.” Jesus said to them, “The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism I am baptized with you will be baptized,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;but to sit at my right or left is not mine to grant; it is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;When the ten heard this, they began to be indignant at James and John.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Jesus called them to himself and said, “You know that those regarded as rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;But it is not so among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;and whoever wants to be first among you must be slave of all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;Then they came to Jericho. As He was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a large crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;When He heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, He began to cry out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;Many rebuked him, telling him to be quiet, but He cried out all the more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;Jesus stopped and said, “Call him.” They called the blind man, saying to him, “Take courage, get up; He is calling you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;Throwing off his cloak, He sprang up and came to Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to him, “What do you want me to do for you?” The blind man said to him, “Rabboni, I want to see again.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to him, “Go; your faith has healed you.” Immediately He regained his sight and followed him on the way.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;As they approached Jerusalem, near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, He sent two of His disciples,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;saying to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and as soon as you enter it, you will find a colt tied up, on which no man has ever sat. Untie it and bring it here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;If anyone says to you, ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here shortly.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;They went away and found a colt tied near a door, outside in the street. As they untied it,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;some of the men standing there said to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;They answered them just as Jesus had said, and the men let them go.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks over it, and He sat on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Many men spread their cloaks on the road, while others spread branches they had cut from the fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted, "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father, David! Hosanna in the highest!"</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. After looking around at everything, since it was already late, He went out to Bethany with the twelve.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The next day, as they left Bethany, He was hungry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Seeing a fig tree in the distance with leaves, He went to see if He could find anything on it. When He came to it, He found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;He said to it, "May no man eat fruit from you again forever." And His disciples heard Him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;They came to Jerusalem, and He entered the temple and began to drive out those who were buying and selling there. He overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of those selling doves,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;and He would not allow any man to carry anything through the temple.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;He taught them, saying, "Is it not written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations’? But you have made it a den of robbers."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;The chief priests and the scribes heard this and began seeking a way to destroy Him, for they feared Him because the whole crowd was amazed at His teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;When evening came, they went out of the city.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;In the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Peter remembered and said to Him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree You cursed has withered."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Jesus answered them, "Have faith in God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Truly I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what He says will happen, it will be done for him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against any man, so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your trespasses."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;[]</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;They came again to Jerusalem. As He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;and they said to Him, "By what authority are You doing these things? Or who gave You this authority to do them?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question; answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;The baptism of John—was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;They discussed it among themselves, saying, "If we say, ‘From heaven,’ He will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;But if we say, ‘From men’"—they feared the crowd, for all held that John was truly a prophet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;So they answered Jesus, "We do not know." And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</p>

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Then He began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard, set a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, and built a tower. He leased it to tenant farmers and went away on a journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;At the harvest time, He sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But they seized him, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Again, He sent another servant to them, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;He sent another, and that one they killed. And so with many others—some they beat, and others they killed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He still had one left to send, a beloved son. He sent him last of all, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;So they took him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Have you not read this Scripture: ‘The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;this was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the crowd, for they understood that He had spoken the parable against them. So they left him and went away.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Then they sent to him some of the Pharisees and Herodians to trap him in his words.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;They came and said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone’s opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;But knowing their hypocrisy, He said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;They brought one, and He said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” They said to him, “Caesar’s.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they marveled at him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to him and asked him a question, saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;There were seven brothers. The first took a wife, and when He died, He left no offspring.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;The second took her and died, leaving no offspring, and the third likewise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The seven left no offspring. Last of all, the woman also died.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite wrong.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;One of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that He answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;And the scribe said to him, “You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that He is one, and there is no other besides him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one’s neighbor as oneself, is much more than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;And when Jesus saw that He answered wisely, He said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;While Jesus was teaching in the temple, He said, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.”’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;David himself calls him Lord, so how is He his son?” And the great throng heard him gladly.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;In his teaching He said, “Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and receive greetings in the marketplaces&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;who devour widows’ houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;He sat down opposite the treasury and watched the crowd putting money into the offering box. Many rich men put in large sums.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;A poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;He called his disciples to him and said to them, “Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;As He was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Teacher, look! What massive stones and what impressive buildings!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And Jesus said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone will be left on another; all will be thrown down."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;While He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;"Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Jesus began to say to them, "Watch out that no one deceives you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am He,' and they will deceive many.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed; these things must happen, but the end is not yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there will be earthquakes in various places, there will be famines—these are the beginning of birth pains.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;But be on your guard; they will hand you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And the gospel must first be preached to all nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;When they arrest you and hand you over, do not worry beforehand about what you will say, but say whatever is given to you in that hour, for it is not you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise up against parents and have them put to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And you will be hated by all men because of my name, but the one who endures to the end will be saved.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;When you see the abomination of desolation standing where He ought not to be—let the reader understand—then let those in Judea flee to the mountains.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Let the man on the housetop not go down or enter to take anything from his house,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;and let the man in the field not turn back to get his cloak.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Woe to pregnant women and to those nursing infants in those days!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Pray that it may not happen in winter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;For those days will bring tribulation such as has not been seen from the beginning of creation, which God created, until now, and never will be again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;If the Lord had not cut short those days, no flesh would be saved; but for the sake of the elect, whom He chose, He has shortened the days.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there He is!' do not believe it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;But you, be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;And then He will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: when its branch becomes tender and puts out leaves, you know that summer is near.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;So also, when you see these things happening, you know that He is near, at the very gates.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Be on guard, stay awake, for you do not know when the time will come.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;It is like a man going on a journey, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to stay awake.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, stay awake—for you do not know when the master of the house will come, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;lest He come suddenly and find you sleeping.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;What I say to you, I say to all: Stay awake!"</p>

    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;It was now two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;for they were saying, “Not during the festival, lest there be an uproar from the crowd.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;While He was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He reclined at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, pure nard. She broke the flask and poured it over his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;But some were indignantly saying to one another, “Why has this ointment been wasted?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For this could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.” And they scolded her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;But Jesus said, “Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them, but you will not always have me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Truly I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray him to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;When they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. So He began seeking how He might conveniently betray him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;On the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;He sent two of his disciples and said to them, “Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;and wherever He enters, say to the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;He will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; prepare for us there.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The disciples went out, entered the city, and found it just as He had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;When it was evening, He came with the twelve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;As they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, “Truly I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, “Is it I?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;He said to them, “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if He had not been born.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;While they were eating, He took bread, and after blessing it, broke it and gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my body.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Then He took a cup, and after giving thanks, He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;He said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Truly I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away, for it is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;But after I am raised, I will go before you to Galilee.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Peter said to him, “Even if all fall away, I will not.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;But He said emphatically, “Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you.” And they all said the same.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;They came to a place called Gethsemane, and He said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;He took with him Peter, James, and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;He said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Going a little farther, He fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;He came and found them sleeping, and He said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Again He went away and prayed, saying the same words.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;And again He came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;He came the third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Rise, let us go. See, my betrayer is at hand.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;Immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;Coming up at once, He went to him and said, “Rabbi!” and kissed him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;They laid hands on him and seized him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;But one of those standing by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said to them, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;And they all left him and fled.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;A certain young man was following him, wearing nothing but a linen cloth. They seized him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;but He left the linen cloth and ran away naked.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>53</sup>&nbsp;They led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes came together.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;Peter followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest, and He was sitting with the guards, warming himself at the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;Now the chief priests and the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>56</sup>&nbsp;For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>57</sup>&nbsp;Some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>58</sup>&nbsp;“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days I will build another not made with hands.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>59</sup>&nbsp;Yet even about this their testimony did not agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>60</sup>&nbsp;The high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>61</sup>&nbsp;But He remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>62</sup>&nbsp;Jesus said, “I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>63</sup>&nbsp;The high priest tore his garments and said, “What further witnesses do we need?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>64</sup>&nbsp;You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?” They all condemned him as deserving death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>65</sup>&nbsp;Some began to spit on him, to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him, “Prophesy!” And the guards received him with blows.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>66</sup>&nbsp;While Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>67</sup>&nbsp;and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>68</sup>&nbsp;But He denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean.” And He went out into the gateway, and the rooster crowed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>69</sup>&nbsp;The servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>70</sup>&nbsp;But again He denied it. After a little while, the bystanders again said to Peter, “Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>71</sup>&nbsp;But He began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>72</sup>&nbsp;And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And He broke down and wept.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;As soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council. They bound Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" He answered him, "You say so."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The chief priests accused him of many things.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? Look how many charges they bring against you."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Now at the festival He used to release for them one prisoner whom they requested.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;A man called Barabbas was in prison with the rebels who had committed murder during the insurrection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do for them according to his custom.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For He knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas for them instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Pilate, responding again, said to them, "What then do you want me to do with the man you call the King of the Jews?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;They shouted back, "Crucify him!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has He done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them; and after having Jesus flogged, He handed him over to be crucified.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The soldiers led him away into the courtyard, that is, the governor’s headquarters, and they called together the whole cohort.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;They clothed him in a purple robe and, after twisting together a crown of thorns, put it on him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;They struck his head with a reed, spat on him, and knelt down in homage to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;After mocking him, they stripped him of the purple robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;They compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country—the father of Alexander and Rufus—to carry his cross.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Then they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them to decide what each man should take.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;It was the third hour when they crucified him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;The inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;With him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Those passing by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads and saying, "Ha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;save yourself and come down from the cross!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Likewise, the chief priests, along with the scribes, mocked him among themselves, saying, "He saved others; He cannot save himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe." Those crucified with him also reviled him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;When the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;At the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, "Look, He is calling Elijah."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;One man ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see if Elijah comes to take him down."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;But Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;The curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;When the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that He breathed his last in this way, He said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;There were also women watching from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;These women had followed him and ministered to him when He was in Galilee, and many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were there too.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;When evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council who was also himself waiting for the kingdom of God, came and boldly went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;Pilate was surprised that He was already dead; summoning the centurion, He asked him whether He had been dead for some time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;When He learned from the centurion that it was so, He granted the body to Joseph.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;Joseph bought a linen cloth, took him down, wrapped him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. He rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where He was laid.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;After the Sabbath had passed, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so they could go and anoint him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they came to the tomb.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;They were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;But He said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen; He is not here. See the place where they laid him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But go, tell his disciples and Peter, 'He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as He told you.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had driven seven demons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;She went and told those who had been with him, as they were mourning and weeping.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;After this, He appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking into the countryside.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;They returned and reported it to the rest, but they did not believe them either.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Later, He appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at the table. He rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after He had risen.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;He said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;He who believes and is baptized will be saved, but He who does not believe will be condemned.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;These signs will accompany those who believe in my name: they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;they will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not harm them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;So then, after the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word through the accompanying signs.</p>
