    <h1>The Book of Ezra</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, so that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing, saying,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;“Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and He has charged me to build Him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Whoever among you of all His people (may his God be with him) let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel. He is the God who is in Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And every survivor, wherever he sojourns, let the men of his place assist him with silver, gold, goods, and cattle, together with freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Then the heads of the fathers’ houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, everyone whose spirit God had stirred, rose up to go and rebuild the house of the LORD that is in Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And all those around them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with cattle, and with precious things, besides all that was freely offered.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And King Cyrus brought out the vessels of the house of the LORD which Nebuchadnezzar had brought out from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Cyrus king of Persia brought them out under the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;And this was their number: thirty gold basins, one thousand silver basins, twenty-nine knives,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;thirty gold bowls, four hundred ten silver bowls of a second sort, and one thousand other vessels.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;All the vessels of gold and silver were five thousand four hundred. All these Sheshbazzar brought up when the exiles were brought up from Babylon to Jerusalem.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now these are the sons of the province who went up from the captivity of the exiles whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had carried away to Babylon, and who returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each to his own city.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, and Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Parosh, two thousand one hundred seventy-two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy-two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Arah, seven hundred seventy-five.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Pahath-moab, of the sons of Jeshua and Joab, two thousand eight hundred twelve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Zattu, nine hundred forty-five.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Zaccai, seven hundred sixty.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Bani, six hundred forty-two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Bebai, six hundred twenty-three.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Azgad, one thousand two hundred twenty-two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Adonikam, six hundred sixty-six.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Bigvai, two thousand fifty-six.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Adin, four hundred fifty-four.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Ater, of Hezekiah, ninety-eight.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Bezai, three hundred twenty-three.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Jorah, one hundred twelve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Hashum, two hundred twenty-three.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Gibbar, ninety-five.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;The men of Bethlehem, one hundred twenty-three.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The men of Netophah, fifty-six.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;The men of Anathoth, one hundred twenty-eight.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Azmaveth, forty-two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Kiriath-arim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred forty-three.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Ramah and Geba, six hundred twenty-one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;The men of Michmas, one hundred twenty-two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;The men of Bethel and Ai, two hundred twenty-three.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Nebo, fifty-two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Magbish, one hundred fifty-six.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;The sons of the other Elam, one thousand two hundred fifty-four.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Harim, three hundred twenty.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty-five.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Jericho, three hundred forty-five.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Senaah, three thousand six hundred thirty.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;The priests: the sons of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua, nine hundred seventy-three.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Immer, one thousand fifty-two.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Pashhur, one thousand two hundred forty-seven.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Harim, one thousand seventeen.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;The Levites: the sons of Jeshua and Kadmiel, of the sons of Hodaviah, seventy-four.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;The singers: the sons of Asaph, one hundred twenty-eight.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;The sons of the gatekeepers: the sons of Shallum, the sons of Ater, the sons of Talmon, the sons of Akkub, the sons of Hatita, the sons of Shobai, one hundred thirty-nine.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;The temple servants: the sons of Ziha, the sons of Hasupha, the sons of Tabbaoth,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Keros, the sons of Siaha, the sons of Padon,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Lebanah, the sons of Hagabah, the sons of Akkub,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Hagab, the sons of Shamlai, the sons of Hanan,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Giddel, the sons of Gahar, the sons of Reaiah,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Rezin, the sons of Nekoda, the sons of Gazzam,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Uzza, the sons of Paseah, the sons of Besai,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Asnah, the sons of Meunim, the sons of Nephisim,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Bakbuk, the sons of Hakupha, the sons of Harhur,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Bazluth, the sons of Mehida, the sons of Harsha,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>53</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Barkos, the sons of Sisera, the sons of Temah,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Neziah, the sons of Hatipha.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Solomon’s servants: the sons of Sotai, the sons of Hassophereth, the sons of Peruda,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>56</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Jaala, the sons of Darkon, the sons of Giddel,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>57</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth-hazzebaim, the sons of Ami.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>58</sup>&nbsp;All the temple servants and the sons of Solomon’s servants were three hundred ninety-two.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>59</sup>&nbsp;And these were the ones who came up from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they could not show their fathers’ houses or their ancestry, whether they were from Israel:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>60</sup>&nbsp;the sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred fifty-two.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>61</sup>&nbsp;And of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Hakkoz, the sons of Barzillai, who had taken a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite and was called by their name.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>62</sup>&nbsp;These sought their record among those registered by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore they were considered unclean and excluded from the priesthood.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>63</sup>&nbsp;And the governor told them that they should not eat from the most holy things until a priest stood up with Urim and Thummim.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>64</sup>&nbsp;The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand three hundred sixty,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>65</sup>&nbsp;besides their male and female servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven, and among them two hundred male and female singers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>66</sup>&nbsp;Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six, their mules two hundred forty-five,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>67</sup>&nbsp;their camels four hundred thirty-five, and their donkeys six thousand seven hundred twenty.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>68</sup>&nbsp;Some of the heads of fathers’ houses, when they came to the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of God to establish it in its place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>69</sup>&nbsp;They gave according to their ability for the treasury of the work sixty-one thousand gold drachmas, five thousand silver minas, and one hundred priests’ garments.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>70</sup>&nbsp;So the priests and the Levites and some of the people, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple servants lived in their towns, and all Israel in their towns.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;When the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and his brothers, arose and built the altar of the God of Israel to offer burnt offerings on it, as it is written in the Law of Moses, the man of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;They set the altar in its place, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they offered burnt offerings on it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And they kept the Feast of Booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as the duty of each day required,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and afterward the continual burnt offering, and those for the new moons, and for all the appointed feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and those of everyone who offered a freewill offering to the LORD.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD, but the foundation of the temple of the LORD had not yet been laid.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sidonians and to the Tyrians, to bring cedar wood from Lebanon to the sea at Joppa, according to the permission granted them by Cyrus king of Persia.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Now in the second year after their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak and the rest of their brothers, the priests and the Levites, and all who came from the captivity to Jerusalem, began the work. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to supervise the work of the house of the LORD.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together stood to oversee those who worked in the house of God, along with the sons of Henadad, their sons and brothers, the Levites.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;When the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests stood in their vestments with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD according to the directions of David king of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And they sang responsively, giving thanks to the LORD:</p>

    <p>“For He is good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for His steadfast love toward Israel endures forever.”</p>

    <p>And all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD had been laid.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers’ houses, the old men who had seen the former house, wept with a loud voice when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, while many shouted aloud for joy,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people’s weeping, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the sound was heard far away.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;When the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the LORD, the God of Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of fathers’ houses and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we seek your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the fathers’ houses of Israel said to them, “You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God, but we ourselves alone will build to the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And in the reign of Ahasuerus, at the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their associates wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. The letter was written in Aramaic and translated from Aramaic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Then Rehum the commander and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa (that is, the Elamites),&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar deported and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the province Beyond the River, wrote.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;This is the copy of the letter they sent to him:</p>

    <p>“To Artaxerxes the king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River, and now:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have come to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city, finishing its walls and repairing the foundations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Now let it be known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to see the king’s dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;so that a search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will find in the record and know that this city is a rebellious city, harmful to kings and provinces, and that rebellion has been stirred up in it from ancient days. For this reason the city was destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;We make known to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will have no possession Beyond the River.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;The king sent an answer:</p>

    <p>“To Rehum the commander, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their associates who live in Samaria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, peace. And now:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;The letter that you sent to us has been clearly read before me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;And I issued a decree, and a search has been made, and it has been found that this city from ancient days has risen up against kings, and rebellion and sedition have been made in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Mighty kings have ruled over Jerusalem, who have ruled over all the province Beyond the River, and tribute, custom, and toll were paid to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Therefore make a decree to stop these men, that this city be not rebuilt until a decree is made by me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;And take care not to be negligent in this matter. Why should damage increase to the detriment of the kings?”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Then, when the copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their associates, they went quickly to the Jews in Jerusalem and by force and power made them stop.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Then the work of the house of God that is in Jerusalem stopped, and it was halted until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Then the prophets Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God that is in Jerusalem, and the prophets of God were with them, supporting them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;At that time Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and their associates came to them and said to them, “Who issued a decree for you to build this house and to finish this structure?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;They also said to them, “What are the names of the men who are building this building?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them until a report should come to Darius and a written answer be returned concerning it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;This is the copy of the letter that Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai and his associates, the officials who were in the province Beyond the River, sent to Darius the king.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;They sent him a report, in which it was written as follows:</p>

    <p>“To Darius the king, all peace.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Let it be known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built with large stones, and timber is being laid in the walls. This work is being done with diligence and is prospering in their hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Then we asked those elders and said to them, ‘Who issued a decree for you to build this house and to finish this structure?’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;We also asked them their names, in order to make them known to you, that we might write down the names of the men who are at their head.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And this was their answer to us: ‘We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;But because our fathers angered the God of heaven, He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried the people away to Babylon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, King Cyrus brought out of the temple of Babylon, and they were given to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made governor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And he said to him, “Take these vessels, go, and put them in the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Then that Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God that is in Jerusalem. And from that time until now it has been under construction, and it is not yet finished.’</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, if it seems good to the king, let a search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether it is so that a decree was issued by King Cyrus to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem. Then let the king send us his decision concerning this matter.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Then King Darius issued a decree, and a search was made in the archives where the treasures were stored in Babylon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And in Ecbatana, the fortress which is in the province of Media, a scroll was found, and in it this was written for a record:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;“In the first year of Cyrus the king, King Cyrus issued a decree: Concerning the house of God in Jerusalem, let the house be rebuilt, the place where they offer sacrifices, and let its foundations be firmly laid. Its height shall be sixty cubits, and its width sixty cubits,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;with three layers of large stones and one layer of timber. Let the cost be given from the royal treasury.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;And also let the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, be restored and brought back to the temple in Jerusalem, each to its place, and put them in the house of God.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;“Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and your associates, the officials Beyond the River, keep away from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Leave the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of the Jews and the elders of the Jews rebuild this house of God on its site.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Moreover, I issue a decree concerning what you shall do for these elders of the Jews in the rebuilding of this house of God: the cost is to be paid in full to these men from the royal revenue, from the tribute of the province Beyond the River, without delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;And whatever is needed—young bulls, rams, lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the request of the priests who are in Jerusalem—let it be given to them day by day without fail,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;that they may offer pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king and his sons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Also I issue a decree that if anyone alters this edict, a beam shall be pulled out of his house and he shall be impaled on it, and his house shall be made a pile of rubble for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And may the God who has caused His name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who shall put forth a hand to alter this or to destroy this house of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued the decree; let it be done with diligence.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Then Tattenai, governor of the province Beyond the River, Shethar-bozenai, and their associates did with all diligence what Darius the king had ordered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And the elders of the Jews built and prospered through the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo. They finished building according to the decree of the God of Israel and by the decree of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the returned exiles, celebrated the dedication of this house of God with joy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;They offered for the dedication of this house of God one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering for all Israel, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their orders for the service of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;On the fourteenth day of the first month, the returned exiles kept the Passover.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. They slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their brothers the priests, and for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;And the sons of Israel who had returned from exile ate it, together with all who had separated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land to seek the LORD, the God of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;And they kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread seven days with joy, for the LORD had made them joyful and had turned the heart of the king of Assyria toward them, to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra son of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;this Ezra went up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given; and the king granted him all that he requested, for the hand of the LORD his God was upon him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Some of the sons of Israel and some of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants went up to Jerusalem in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the seventh year of the king.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For on the first day of the first month he began to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, for the good hand of his God was upon him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For Ezra had set his heart to study the Law of the LORD, to do it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Now this is the copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commandments of the LORD and of His statutes for Israel:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;“Artaxerxes, king of kings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven: Peace. And now:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;I issue a decree that any of the sons of Israel and their priests and Levites in my kingdom who freely choose to go to Jerusalem may go with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;For you are sent by the king and his seven counselors to inquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem according to the Law of your God which is in your hand,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;and to bring the silver and gold that the king and his counselors have freely offered to the God of Israel, whose dwelling is in Jerusalem,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;and all the silver and gold that you find in all the province of Babylon, together with the freewill offering of the people and the priests, offered willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Therefore you shall with diligence buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs, with their grain offerings and their drink offerings, and offer them on the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And whatever seems good to you and your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, you may do according to the will of your God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;The vessels that are given to you for the service of the house of your God, deliver before the God of Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;And whatever else may be needed for the house of your God, which you have occasion to provide, provide it from the royal treasury.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;And I, Artaxerxes the king, issue a decree to all the treasurers who are in the province Beyond the River, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the Law of the God of heaven, requires of you, it shall be done with all diligence,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;up to one hundred talents of silver, one hundred cors of wheat, one hundred baths of wine, one hundred baths of oil, and salt without limit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be done with diligence for the house of the God of heaven, so that wrath may not come upon the kingdom of the king and his sons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;We also make known to you that it shall not be lawful to impose tribute, custom, or toll on any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;And you, Ezra, according to the wisdom of your God that is in your hand, appoint magistrates and judges to judge all the people who are in the province Beyond the River, all who know the laws of your God; and those who do not know them, you shall teach.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;And whoever will not obey the law of your God and the law of the king, let judgment be executed upon him with all diligence, whether for death or for banishment, or for confiscation of goods, or for imprisonment.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Blessed be the LORD, the God of our fathers, who put such a thing as this into the heart of the king, to glorify the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;and who extended steadfast love to me before the king, his counselors, and all the mighty officials of the king. And I took courage, for the hand of the LORD my God was upon me, and I gathered leading men from Israel to go up with me.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;These are the heads of their fathers’ houses and the genealogical list of those who went up with me from Babylon in the reign of King Artaxerxes:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Of the sons of Phinehas, Gershom; of the sons of Ithamar, Daniel; of the sons of David, Hattush;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Shecaniah, of the sons of Parosh, Zechariah, and with him were registered one hundred fifty males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Pahath-moab, Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Shecaniah, the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Adin, Ebed son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Elam, Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Shephatiah, Zebadiah son of Michael, and with him eighty males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Joab, Obadiah son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred eighteen males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Bani, Shelomith son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred sixty males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Bebai, Zechariah son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Azgad, Johanan son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred ten males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Adonikam, those who came later, their names being Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;of the sons of Bigvai, Uthai and Zabbud, and with them seventy males.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;I gathered them by the river that runs to Ahava, and we camped there three days. I looked among the people and the priests but found none of the sons of Levi there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Then I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, leading men, and also for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And I sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphia, and told them what to say to Iddo and his brothers, the temple servants at the place Casiphia, to bring us ministers for the house of our God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of insight, of the sons of Mahli son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebiah with his sons and his brothers, eighteen;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, with his brothers and their sons, twenty;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;and from the temple servants, whom David and the officials had appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred twenty temple servants. All of them were listed by name.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river Ahava, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from Him a safe journey for us, our children, and all our goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from the enemy on the way, since we had said to the king, “The hand of our God is upon all who seek Him for good, but His power and His wrath are against all who forsake Him.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;So we fasted and sought our God for this, and He listened to our prayer.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;and I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God that the king and his counselors and his princes and all Israel there present had offered.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;I weighed out into their hand six hundred fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels worth one hundred talents, and one hundred talents of gold,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;and twenty bowls of gold worth one thousand darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze, as precious as gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;And I said to them, “You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Guard them carefully until you weigh them before the leading priests, the Levites, and the heads of fathers’ houses in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;So the priests and the Levites received the weighed-out silver and gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Then we set out from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem. The hand of our God was upon us, and He delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of those who lay in wait by the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;We came to Jerusalem and stayed there three days.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;On the fourth day, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God into the hand of Meremoth son of Uriah the priest, and with him was Eleazar son of Phinehas, and with them the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Everything was counted and weighed, and all the weight was recorded at that time.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;The exiles who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel: twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering—all as a burnt offering to the LORD.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;They also delivered the king’s decrees to the king’s satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and they supported the people and the house of God.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;After these things were done, the officials approached me, saying, “The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations—from the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, the Ammonite, the Moabite, the Egyptian, and the Amorite.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed has mixed with the peoples of the lands. The hand of the officials and rulers has been foremost in this unfaithfulness.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;When I heard this word, I tore my garment and my cloak and pulled hair from my head and beard and sat appalled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered to me because of the unfaithfulness of the exiles, while I sat appalled until the evening offering.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;At the time of the evening offering I rose from my self-abasement, with my garment and my cloak torn, and fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and said, “O my God, I am ashamed and humiliated to lift my face to You, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has grown up to the heavens.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;From the days of our fathers until this day we have been in great guilt. Because of our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands—to the sword, to captivity, to plunder, and to open shame, as it is this day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But now for a brief moment grace has been shown from the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant and to give us a peg in His holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For we are slaves, yet our God has not abandoned us in our slavery, but has extended steadfast love to us before the kings of Persia, to give us a reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken Your commandments,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;which You commanded by Your servants the prophets, saying, ‘The land that you are entering to possess is a land defiled by the impurity of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations that have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Therefore do not give your daughters to their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your sons forever.’&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;After all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, since You our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us such a remnant as this,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;shall we again break Your commandments and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Would You not be angry with us until You consumed us, so that there would be no remnant nor any who escape?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;O LORD, God of Israel, You are righteous, for we are left as a remnant that has escaped, as it is this day. See, we are before You in our guilt, for none can stand before You because of this.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;While Ezra was praying and confessing, weeping and falling down before the house of God, a very great assembly of Israel, men, women, and children, gathered to him, for the people wept bitterly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And Shecaniah son of Jehiel, of the sons of Elam, answered and said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, yet now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to send away all the wives and those born of them, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Arise, for it is your task, and we are with you; be strong and act.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests, the Levites, and all Israel swear that they would do according to this word. So they swore.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God and went to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. There he spent the night; he did not eat bread or drink water, for he was mourning over the unfaithfulness of the exiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And they made a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;and that whoever did not come within three days, according to the counsel of the officials and the elders, all his property should be forfeited, and he himself separated from the assembly of the exiles.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within three days—it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month—and all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful and have married foreign women, increasing the guilt of Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Now make confession to the LORD, the God of your fathers, and do His will. Separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign women.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Then all the assembly answered and said with a loud voice, “It is so; we must do as you have said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But the people are many, and it is the season of heavy rain, and we cannot stand outside. Nor is this a work that can be done in one or two days, for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Let our officials stand for the whole assembly, and let all in our cities who have married foreign women come at appointed times, and with them the elders of each city and its judges, until the fierce wrath of our God concerning this matter is turned from us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah stood against this, and Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite supported them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Then the exiles did so. Ezra the priest selected men who were heads of fathers’ houses, according to their fathers’ houses, all of them designated by name. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to examine the matter,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;and by the first day of the first month they had finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Now, among the sons of the priests who had married foreign women, were found the sons of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers, Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;They pledged themselves to send away their wives, and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;From the sons of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;From the sons of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;From the sons of Pashhur: Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;From the Levites: Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is, Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;From the singers: Eliashib. From the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;And from Israel: from the sons of Parosh, Ramiah, Izziah, Malchijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Pahath-moab: Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Harim: Eliezer, Isshijah, Malchijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasai,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;Bani, Binnui, Shimei,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;from the sons of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;All these had taken foreign wives, and some of them had wives who bore children.</p>
