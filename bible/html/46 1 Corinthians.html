    <h1>The First Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;to the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, together with all who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;that in every way you were enriched in him—in all speech and all knowledge—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;just as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;so that you do not lack any gift as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He will also strengthen you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;I urge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mindset and the same conviction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there are quarrels among you, my brothers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;What I mean is this: each of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;so that no one can say you were baptized in my name.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;(I did baptize the household of Stephanas too; but beyond that, I don’t remember if I baptized anyone else.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—though not with eloquent wisdom, so the cross of Christ would not be emptied of its power.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;For it is written:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will frustrate the understanding of the intelligent.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made the world’s wisdom foolish?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God because of wisdom, God was pleased through the foolishness of what is preached to save those who believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For Jews ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;but we preach Christ crucified—a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, and God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not valued, to bring to nothing things that are,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;so that no man may boast in God’s presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;so that, as it is written: “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;When I came to you, brothers, I didn’t come with impressive speech or wisdom as I proclaimed to you the mystery of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ—and Him crucified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I was with you in weakness, in fear, and with much trembling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;My message and my preaching weren’t delivered with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;so that your faith wouldn’t rest on human wisdom but on God’s power.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Now we do speak wisdom among the mature—but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are passing away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Instead, we speak God’s wisdom in a mystery, the hidden wisdom God appointed ahead of time, before the world began, for our glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;None of the rulers of this age understood it, because if they had, they wouldn’t have crucified the Lord of glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;But as it is written:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“What no eye has seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what no ear has heard,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what hasn’t entered the human heart—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God has prepared these things for those who love Him.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Now God has revealed them to us by the Spirit, because the Spirit searches everything—even the depths of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;For who among men knows a man’s thoughts except the spirit of the man within him? In the same way, no one knows God’s thoughts except the Spirit of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Now we haven’t received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;We also speak these things, not in words taught by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual men.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;But the natural man doesn’t accept what comes from the Spirit of God, because it’s foolishness to him. He can’t understand it, because it is spiritually investigated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The spiritual man, however, evaluates everything, but he himself is not evaluated by anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For who has known the mind of the Lord so that he can instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Brothers, I could not speak to you as spiritual men but as men of the flesh, as infants in Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you weren’t ready for it. And even now, you’re still not ready,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;because you’re still of the flesh. For since there is jealousy and strife among you, aren’t you of the flesh, and living like ordinary men?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you acting like mere men?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;What then is Apollos, and what is Paul, exceept servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord assigned tasks to each of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I planted, Apollos watered, but God produced the growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but what is important is God who produces growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Now the one who plants and the one who waters are one, and each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another built on it. But each man must be careful how he builds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;For no one can lay a true foundation other than what is already laid, which is Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;each one’s work will become evident, for the Day will show it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test the quality of each man’s work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;If what someone has built survives, he will receive a reward.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;If someone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved—though only as through fire.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Since you are God’s temple, if anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him, for God’s temple is holy.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks he is wise in this age, he must become a fool so that he may become wise.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;For the wisdom of this world is foolishness before God, as it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness,”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;and again, “The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;So then, let no one boast in men. For all things are yours—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or the present or the future—all are yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Let a man regard us in this way: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But to me it matters very little if I’m judged by you or by any human court; in fact, I don’t even judge myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For I am not aware of anything against myself, yet I’m not justified by this—rather, the one who judges me is the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;So don’t pronounce judgment ahead of time—wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what’s hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of hearts. Then each man will receive his praise from God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Now, brothers, I’ve applied these things to myself and Apollos for your sake, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written, so that none of you becomes arrogant, favoring one person over another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you didn’t receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you hadn’t?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;You’re already full! You’re already rich! You’ve begun to reign without us—and I wish you really were reigning, so that we might reign with you!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For I think God has put us apostles on display last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we’ve become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;To this very hour we go hungry and thirsty, we’re poorly clothed, roughly treated, and homeless.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;We labor, working with our own hands. When we’re insulted, we bless; when we’re persecuted, we endure it;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;when we’re slandered, we answer kindly. We’ve become like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things, to this very moment.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I’m not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;For even if you had ten thousand guardians in Christ, you wouldn’t have many fathers—for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;So I urge you: be imitators of me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;That’s why I sent Timothy to you—he’s my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He’ll remind you of my ways in Christ, just as I teach them everywhere in every church.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Some of you have become arrogant, as if I weren’t coming to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I’ll find out not the talk of these arrogant ones but their power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;For the kingdom of God isn’t about talk, but power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod, or with love and a gentle spirit?</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;It’s widely reported that there’s sexual immorality among you, and it's the kind that doesn’t even happen among the pagans—a man has his father’s wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And you’re proud of yourselves? You should’ve been mourning instead, so that the one who did this would be removed from among you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Even though I’m not physically there, I’m with you in spirit—and I’ve already passed judgment on the one who did this, as though I were there in person.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;When you gather in the name of our Lord Jesus—and I’m with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Your boasting isn’t good. Don’t you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Clean out the old yeast so that you can be a new batch, just as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;So let’s celebrate the feast, not with old yeast—the yeast of malice and evil—but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;I wrote to you in my previous letter not to associate with sexually immoral men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;I wasn’t talking about the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy, or swindlers, or idolaters—otherwise, you’d have to leave the world altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But now I’m writing you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother and yet is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a slanderer, a drunkard, or a swindler. Don’t even eat with such a man.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For what business is it of mine to judge outsiders? Aren’t you supposed to judge those who are inside?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;God will judge those outside. “Remove the wicked man from among you.”</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;If one of you has a dispute with another, how dare he take it to court before the unrighteous instead of before the saints?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Don’t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, aren’t you competent to judge trivial cases?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Don’t you know that we will judge angels—how much more matters of this life?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;So if you have cases involving everyday life, do you appoint those with no standing in the church to judge?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I say this to shame you. Is there really no one wise among you who is able to arbitrate between his brothers?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Instead, brother goes to court against brother—and that before unbelievers!</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Already, then, it’s a complete failure for you to have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be cheated?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Instead, you yourselves do wrong and cheat—and that to your own brothers!</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Don’t you know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don’t be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And some of you were like that. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;“All things are permissible for me”—but not all things are beneficial. “All things are permissible for me”—but I will not be controlled by anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;“Food is for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;God raised the Lord and will also raise us by His power.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Don’t you know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Don’t you know that the one who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For it is written, “The two will become one flesh.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;But the one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Run away from sexual immorality! Every other sin a man commits is outside the body, but the one who commits sexual immorality sins against his own body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Don’t you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;you were bought at a price. So glorify God with your body.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now, regarding what you wrote about: It’s good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;But because sexual immorality is so common, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;A husband must fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise a wife to her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;A wife does not have authority over her own body—her husband does. Likewise, a husband does not have authority over his own body—his wife does.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Do not deprive one another—except by mutual agreement for a set time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then come back together, so that Satan doesn’t tempt you because of your lack of self-control.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I’m saying this as a concession, not as a command.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;I wish all men were like me, but each has his own gift from God—one this way, another that way.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;To the unmarried and to widows I say: it’s good for them to stay single as I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;But if they can’t control themselves, they should get married. It’s better to marry than to burn with desire.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;To the married I give this command—not I, but the Lord: a wife must not separate from her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But if she does separate, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;To the rest I say—I, not the Lord: if a brother has a wife who isn’t a believer, and she’s willing to stay with him, he shouldn’t divorce her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Likewise, if a woman has a husband who isn’t a believer, and he’s willing to stay with her, she shouldn’t divorce him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;For the unbelieving husband is made holy through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy through her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. The brother or sister is not bound in such cases. God has called us to live in peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For how do you know, wife, whether you’ll save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you’ll save your wife?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Only, let each person lead the life the Lord has assigned to him and to which God has called him. This is what I command in all the churches.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Was someone already circumcised when he was called? He shouldn’t try to reverse it. Was someone uncircumcised when he was called? He shouldn’t get circumcised.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Circumcision means nothing, and uncircumcision means nothing. What matters is keeping God’s commandments.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Each man should remain in the condition he was in when God called him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Were you a slave when you were called? Don’t let it bother you—but if you can gain your freedom, take the opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. Likewise, he who was free when called is Christ’s slave.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;You were bought at a price. Don’t become slaves of men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Brothers, each of you should remain before God in the condition in which he was called.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Now about virgins: I have no command from the Lord, but I give an opinion as one who by the Lord’s mercy is trustworthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Because of the present distress, I think it’s good for a man to remain as he is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Are you bound to a wife? Don’t seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Don’t seek a wife.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;But if you do marry, you haven’t sinned; and if a virgin marries, she hasn’t sinned. Yet those who marry will face trouble in this life, and I want to spare you that.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;This is what I mean, brothers: the time is short. From now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;those who weep as though they didn’t weep, those who rejoice as though they didn’t rejoice, those who buy as though they didn’t own anything,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;and those who use the world as though they weren’t engrossed in it. For the present form of this world is passing away.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;I want you to be free from distractions. The unmarried man is concerned with the things of the Lord—how to please the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;But the married man is concerned with the things of the world—how to please his wife—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;and so his interests are divided. The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned with the things of the Lord—so she can be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is concerned with the things of the world—how to please her husband.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;I’m saying this for your own benefit—not to restrict you, but to promote proper behavior and undivided devotion to the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;If a man thinks he’s acting improperly toward the woman he is engaged to, and if she’s past the age for marriage and it has to happen, let him do what he wants—he’s not sinning. Let them marry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;But the one who stands firm in his heart—not under pressure, and with control over his own will—and has decided in his own mind to not marry, he will also do well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;So then, he who marries his girlfriend does well, and he who does not marry her does even better.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;A wife is bound as long as her husband lives. But if her husband dies, she’s free to marry whomever she wants—only in the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;But in my opinion, she would be happier if she stays as she is—and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now concerning food sacrificed to idols: we know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;If anyone thinks he knows something, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;So then, concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is only one God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For even if there were so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came to be, and through whom we exist.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;However, not all have this knowledge. But some, being accustomed to idols until now, eat food as though it were sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Now food will not bring us closer to God; we are no worse if we do not eat, and no better if we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience, if he is weak, be encouraged to eat food sacrificed to idols?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And so by your knowledge, the weak man, the brother for whom Christ died, is destroyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And thus, by sinning against the brothers and wounding their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to stumble.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you—for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;This is my defense to those who examine me:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Do we not have the right to eat and drink?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as the other apostles do, and the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not drink the milk from the flock?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Am I saying this from a merely human perspective? Doesn't the law also say these things?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For it is written in the Law of Moses: “You shall not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” Is God concerned about oxen?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Or is He saying this entirely for our sake? Yes, it was written for our sake, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher to thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;If others have this rightful claim over you, do we not even more? Yet we did not make use of this right. Instead, we endure everything so that we may not put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Do you not know that those who perform the sacred duties eat from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in what is sacrificed on the altar?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living from the gospel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;But I have not used any of these rights, and I am not writing this so that anything may be done for me. For I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my boast.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am under compulsion. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;What then is my reward? That in preaching the gospel I may offer it free of charge, so that I do not make full use of my rights in the gospel.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, so that I might win more converts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;To the Jews I became like a Jew, so that I might win Jews. To those under the law, I became like one under the law—though not being under the law myself—so that I might win those under the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;To those without the law, I became like one without the law—though not being without God’s law but under Christ’s law—so that I might win those without the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;To the weak I became weak, so that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, so that by all means I might save some.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;I do all this for the sake of the gospel, so that I may share in its blessings.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Everyone who competes exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable crown, but we do it for an imperishable one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;So I do not run aimlessly, nor do I box as one beating the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;But I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that after I have preached to others, I myself may not be disqualified.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, all passed through the sea,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;They all ate the same spiritual food,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they were drinking from a spiritual rock that followed them—and that rock was Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Yet God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Now these things happened as examples for us, so that we would not desire evil things as they did.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Do not become idolaters as some of them were, as it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to play.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Nor let us commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, after which twenty-three thousand of them fell in a single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Nor let us put Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by serpents.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Nor grumble, as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;These things happened to them as an example, and were written down for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;So let the one who thinks he stands watch out, so that he does not fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to man. But God is faithful, he will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also provide a way of escape so that you may be able to endure it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;I speak as to sensible men; judge for yourselves what I say.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Consider Israel according to the flesh: are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;What then am I saying? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;No, but that what the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not to God—and I do not want you to become partners with demons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;“All things are lawful,” but not all things are beneficial. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising questions for the sake of conscience,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;for “the earth is the Lord’s, and all it contains.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;If one of the unbelievers invites you and you want to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising questions for the sake of conscience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you and for the sake of conscience—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;not your own conscience, but that of the other. For why should my liberty be judged by another’s conscience?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced for that for which I give thanks?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Give no offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;just as I also try to please everyone in everything, not seeking my own advantage but that of the many, so that they may be saved.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and hold firmly to the traditions just as I delivered them to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of a woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for she is just like a woman whose head is shaved.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For if a woman does not cover her head, let her also cut her hair off. But if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or her head shaved, let her cover her head.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; while the woman is the glory of man.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For man was not created from woman, but woman from man.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For indeed man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Therefore the woman ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;However, in the Lord, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For just as the woman is from the man, so also the man is through the woman; and all things are from God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;but if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her? For her hair is given to her for a covering.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;But if anyone is being argumentative about this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;But in giving this instruction, I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that divisions exist among you, and in part I believe it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;For there must be factions among you, so that those who are the true believers may be revealed.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Therefore when you assemble together, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;for in eating, each one takes his own food first, and one is hungry while another is drunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night in which He was betrayed, took bread;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;In the same way, He also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;But let a man examine himself carefully, and then let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;For the one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment to himself.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be judged.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord so that we will not be condemned along with the world.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that you do not come together for judgment. The remaining matters I will arrange when I come.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now, concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;You know that when you were Gentiles, you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and there are varieties of services, but the same Lord;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and there are varieties of works, but it is the same God who works all things in all.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For to one is given through the Spirit a word of wisdom, to another a word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the one Spirit,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;to another, workings of miracles, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But the one and same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so also is Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and we were all given to drink of one Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;However, the body is not one member, but many.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” it does not for that reason cease to be part of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” it does not for that reason cease to be part of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;But now God has arranged the members, each one of them, in the body just as He desired.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;And if they were all one member, where would the body be?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;But now there are many members, but one body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;And the eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;On the contrary, those members of the body that seem to be weaker are much more necessary,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;and those parts of the body we think less honorable, we bestow with greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;whereas our presentable parts have no need. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;And if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Now you are the body of Christ, and individually members of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, and various kinds of tongues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all perform miracles?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I will show you an even more excellent way.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;And if I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so as to move mountains but yet I do not have love, I am nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;And if I give away all my possessions and hand over my body to be burned, but do not have love, I gain nothing.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Love is patient; love is kind. It does not envy; it does not boast; it is not arrogant.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;It does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own; it is not easily provoked; it does not keep a record of wrongs.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;It does not rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, one day they stop; if tongues, they will no longer exist; if knowledge, it will be brought to nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For we know in part and we prophesy in part,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away with.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I did away with childish things.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For now we see through a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, even as I also have been fully known.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;So now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For the one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he speaks mysteries in the Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to men for their edification, encouragement, and comfort.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but the one who prophesies edifies the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may receive edification.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what benefit will I be to you unless I speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophecy, or by teaching?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Even lifeless things that produce sound, whether flute or harp, if they do not give a distinction in the notes, how will what is played on the flute or harp be recognized?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For if the trumpet gives an unclear sound, who will prepare himself for battle?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;So also with you: unless you utter intelligible speech with the tongue, how will what is spoken be understood? You will be speaking into the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;There are, doubtless, many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But if I do not understand the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;So also you—since you are zealous for spiritual gifts—strive to abound in those that build up the church.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, let the one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may interpret.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;What is the result then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing praise with the spirit, and I will also sing praise with the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Otherwise, if you give thanks with the spirit only, how will the one who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other is not edified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Nevertheless, in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;In the Law it is written: “By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners I will speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me,” says the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;So then, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;What then is the outcome, brothers? When you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;If anyone speaks in a tongue, it must be by two or at most three, and each in turn, and let one interpret.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;But if there is no interpreter, he must keep silent in the church and speak to himself and to God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;But if a revelation is made to another who is seated, let the first keep silent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;For God is not a God of confusion but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Let the women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak, but must be in submission, just as the Law also says.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;If they want to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;If anyone thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;But if anyone ignores this, he is to be ignored.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, brothers, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;But let all things be done properly and in an orderly manner.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now I make known to you, brothers, the gospel which I proclaimed to you, which you also received, in which you also stand,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;through which also you are being saved—if you hold firmly to the word I proclaimed to you—unless you believed in vain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;After that, he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at once, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. Instead, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Whether then it was I or they, this is what we preached, and this is what you believed.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Now if Christ is being proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is empty, and your faith is also empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Moreover, we are found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that he raised Christ—whom he did not raise if indeed the dead are not raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For since through a man came death, through a man also came the resurrection of the dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ at his coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;The last enemy to be abolished is death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;For “he has subjected all things under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are subjected,” it is clear that it excludes the one who subjected all things to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;And when all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him, so that God may be all in all.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they even baptized for them?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And why are we in danger every hour?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;I die daily—by my boasting in you, brothers, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus with human motives, what did it profit me? If the dead are not raised, “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Sober up as you ought, and stop sinning; for some have no knowledge of God—I say this to your shame.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;You fool! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;And what you sow, you do not sow the body that will be, but a bare kernel—perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;But God gives it a body just as he wills, and to each of the seeds its own body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind for men, another flesh for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is one kind, and the glory of the earthly is another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living soul”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural; then the spiritual.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;The first man is from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;As is the man made of dust, so also are those made of dust; and as is the heavenly man, so also are those who are heavenly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;And just as we have borne the image of the man made of dust, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly man.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;Now I say this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does corruption inherit incorruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>53</sup>&nbsp;For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;But when this corruptible puts on incorruption, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will come to pass: “Death has been swallowed up in victory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;“O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>56</sup>&nbsp;The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>57</sup>&nbsp;But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>58</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so also you are to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;On the first day of every week, let each man set aside something, saving up whatever he may prosper in, so that collections need not be made when I come.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;And when I arrive, I will send whomever you approve with letters to carry your gift to Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;If it seems advisable that I also go, they will go with me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;But I will come to you after passing through Macedonia—for I am passing through Macedonia—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I go.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But I will remain in Ephesus until Pentecost,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;for a wide and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he is doing the work of the Lord just as I am.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Therefore let no man despise him. But send him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Now concerning our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers, but it was not at all his desire to go now. He will go when he has the opportunity.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Let all that you do be done in love.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Now I urge you, brothers—you know the household of Stephanas, that it was the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;that you also be subject to such men and to every fellow worker and laborer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore recognize such men.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, together with the church that is in their house.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;This greeting is in my, Paul's, own hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;If any man does not love the Lord, let him be accursed. Maranatha!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
