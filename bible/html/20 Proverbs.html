    <h1>The Proverbs</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;To know wisdom and instruction, to discern the sayings of understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;to receive instruction in wise behavior, righteousness, justice, and integrity,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;to give prudence to the naïve, knowledge and discretion to the youth—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;let the wise man hear and increase in learning, and let the man of understanding acquire guidance—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;to understand a proverb and a figure, the words of the wise and their riddles.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Hear, my son, your father’s instruction, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;for they are a garland of grace on your head and necklaces about your neck.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;If they say, “Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without cause;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;let us swallow them alive like the grave, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;we will find all sorts of precious possessions, we will fill our houses with spoil;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;cast your lot among us; let us all have one purse”—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;my son, do not walk in the way with them; restrain your foot from their path,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;for their feet run to evil, and they hasten to shed blood.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Surely, in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;but they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Such are the ways of everyone who gains by violence; it takes away the life of its possessors.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Wisdom cries out in the street; she lifts her voice in the public square.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;At the head of the noisy streets she calls out; at the entrances of the gates in the city she utters her sayings:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;“How long, O naïve ones, will you love simplicity? And how long will scoffers delight in their scoffing, and fools hate knowledge?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Turn at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Because I called and you refused, I stretched out my hand and no one paid attention,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;and you neglected all my counsel and did not want my reproof,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your dread comes,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;when your dread comes like a storm, and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but will not find me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;they would not accept my counsel; they spurned all my reproof—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;so they shall eat the fruit of their way and be filled with their own devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;For the waywardness of the naïve will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;But he who listens to me will dwell securely and will be at ease, without dread of evil.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments within you,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;making your ear attentive to wisdom, inclining your heart to understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;yes, if you call out for discernment, raise your voice for understanding.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;If you seek her like silver and search for her as for hidden treasures,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk in integrity,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of His saints.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity—every good path;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;for wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;It will deliver you from the way of evil, from men who speak perverse things,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perversity of the wicked,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Stay away from the strange woman, from the foreign woman with her smooth words,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;None who go to her return, nor do they attain the paths of life.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For the upright will dwell in the land, and the blameless will remain in it;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be uprooted from it.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Do not let kindness and truth forsake you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;so you will find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Do not be wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD and turn away from evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;My son, do not despise the discipline of the LORD, and do not loathe His reproof,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;for the LORD loves those whom He reproves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Blessed is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;for her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her yield than fine gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;The LORD founded the earth by wisdom; He established the heavens by understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;By His knowledge the deeps were split, and the clouds produce dew.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;My son, do not let them escape from your sight; keep sound wisdom and discretion,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;and they will be life to your soul and adornment to your neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Then you will walk securely on your way, and your foot will not stumble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the storm of the wicked when it comes,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;for the LORD will be your confidence and will guard your foot from being caught.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Do not say to your neighbor, “Go and come again; tomorrow I will give it”—when you have it with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Do not plot harm against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Do not contend with a man for no reason, if he has done you no harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Do not envy a violent man, and do not choose any of his ways,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;for the devious man is an abomination to the LORD, but His secret counsel is with the upright.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked, but He blesses the dwelling of the righteous.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;He mocks the mockers, but gives grace to the humble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;The wise will inherit honor, but fools display dishonor.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Hear, O sons, the instruction of a father, and pay attention, that you may gain understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;for I give you good teaching; do not forsake my instruction.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;When I was a son to my father, tender and the only one in the sight of my mother,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;he taught me and said to me, “Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments and live.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and with all your ability, get understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Prize her, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;She will place on your head a garland of grace; she will bestow on you a crown of beauty.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Hear, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;I have taught you in the way of wisdom; I have led you in paths of uprightness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;When you walk, your step will not be hindered, and if you run, you will not stumble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Hold fast to instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of evil men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Avoid it; do not pass by it; turn away from it and pass on.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;The road the righteous travel is like the light of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until full day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know what they stumble over.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Do not let them depart from your eyes; keep them in the midst of your heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For they are life to those who find them and healing to all their flesh.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Put away from yourself crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Let your eyes look directly ahead, and let your gaze be straight before you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Make the path of your foot level, and all your ways will be established.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;that you may guard discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For the lips of the strange woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Her feet go down to death; her steps lay hold of the grave.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;She does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Now then, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Keep your path far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;lest you give your vigor to others and your years to the cruel one;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;lest strangers be filled with your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and your body are consumed,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and you say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I was almost in utter ruin in the midst of the assembly and congregation.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Let them be yours alone and not for strangers with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;a loving doe, a graceful gazelle—let her breasts satisfy you at all times; be intoxicated always in her love.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Why, my son, should you be intoxicated with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a foreigner?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For the ways of a man are before the eyes of the LORD, and He watches all his paths.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The iniquities of the wicked will ensnare him, and he will be held fast in the cords of his sin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;He will die for lack of discipline, and in the greatness of his folly he will go astray.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;My son, if you have become surety for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;if you are snared by the words of your mouth, caught by the words of your mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;then do this, my son, and deliver yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go, humble yourself, and urge your neighbor;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Deliver yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, and like a bird from the hand of the fowler.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Go to the ant, O sluggard; observe her ways and be wise,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;who, having no chief, officer, or ruler,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;prepares her food in the summer and gathers her provision in the harvest.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;How long will you lie down, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;and your poverty will come like a prowler, and your want like an armed man.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, signaling with his fingers;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;perversity is in his heart; he continually devises evil; he spreads strife.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Therefore his calamity will come suddenly; in a moment he will be broken without remedy.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;There are six things that the LORD hates, even seven that are an abomination to Him:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that run swiftly to evil,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who spreads strife among brothers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Bind them continually on your heart; tie them around your neck.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;When you walk, it will lead you; when you lie down, it will watch over you; and when you awake, it will speak with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the foreign woman.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelids.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;For on account of a prostitute one is reduced to a loaf of bread, and a man’s wife hunts down a precious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Can a man carry fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Or can a man walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife; whoever touches her will not go unpunished.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;but if he is found, he must repay sevenfold; he must give all the substance of his house.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;He who commits adultery with a woman lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Wounds and dishonor he will get, and his reproach will not be wiped away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;For jealousy enrages a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;he will not accept any ransom, nor will he be appeased though you multiply gifts.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;My son, hold fast to my words and store up my commands within you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Keep my commands so that you may live, and treasure my teaching like the gem of your eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your close companion,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;to guard you from the adulterous woman, from the seductive stranger with her smooth words.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For I looked out through the lattice of my window,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;and I saw among the naive—I noticed among the young men—a youth lacking sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He was passing along the street near her corner, walking toward her house,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;in the twilight, as evening fell, in the dark of night and shadows.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Then a woman came toward him, dressed like a prostitute, with a cunning heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;She was loud and defiant; her feet never stayed at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurked at every corner.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;She grabbed him and kissed him; with a brazen face, she said to him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;“I had to offer peace offerings; today I fulfilled my vows.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;That’s why I came out to meet you, to seek you eagerly—and I’ve found you!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;I’ve spread my bed with coverings, with colored linens from Egypt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;I’ve perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Come, let’s drink deeply of love until morning; let’s delight ourselves with passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;For my husband isn’t home; he’s gone on a long journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;He took a bag of money with him; he won’t return until the full moon.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;With her many persuasions, she seduced him; with her smooth talk, she led him astray.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;He followed her at once, like an ox going to the slaughter, or like a stag caught in a trap,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;until an arrow pierces its liver—like a bird rushing into a snare, unaware that it will cost him his life.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Now, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to the words of my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Don’t let your heart turn aside to her ways; don’t stray into her paths.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;For she has brought down many victims; her slain are a vast throng.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Her house is the road to the grave, descending to the chambers of death.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Does not Wisdom call out, and Understanding raise her voice?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;On the heights, beside the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Beside the gates, at the entrance to the city, at the access points she cries aloud:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;“To you, O men, I call out, and my voice is to the sons of man.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Understand shrewdness, O simple ones; and you fools, have an understanding heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Listen, for I will speak noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal uprightness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For my mouth will utter truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;All the words of my mouth are righteous; none of them are twisted or crooked.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;They are all clear to the discerning and right to those who find knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Receive my instruction and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;For Wisdom is better than jewels, and all desirable things cannot compare with her.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverse speech I hate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Counsel and sound wisdom are mine; I am understanding, I have might.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;By me princes govern, and nobles—all who judge rightly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield better than choice silver.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;to give wealth to those who love me and to fill their treasuries.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The Lord created me at the beginning of His way, before His deeds of old.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, from before the earth began.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no springs abounding with water.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;before He made the earth and its fields, or the first dust of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;When He established the heavens, I was there; when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;when He made firm the skies above; when the fountains of the deep surged forth;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;when He set limits for the sea so the waters would not transgress His command; when He marked out the foundations of the earth—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;then I was beside Him, like a master craftsman, and I was His delight day by day, rejoicing always before Him,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;rejoicing in the inhabited world, and delighting in the sons of man.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;So now, sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;But he who sins against me injures his own soul; all who hate me love death.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how much more when he brings it with evil intent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;A false witness will perish,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Do not toil to become rich; cease from your own understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;When your eyes look on it, it is gone, for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away like an eagle toward heaven.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Do not eat the bread of a stingy man, nor desire his delicacies,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;for as he calculates within himself, so he is. “Eat and drink,” he says to you, but his heart is not with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;You will vomit the morsel you have eaten and waste your pleasant words.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with the rod, he will not die.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;You shall strike him with the rod and deliver his life from the grave.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;My son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will rejoice;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;my inmost being will exult when your lips speak what is right.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Do not let your heart envy sinners, but live in the fear of the LORD all day long.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Do not be among heavy drinkers of wine or among gluttonous eaters of meat,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and drowsiness will clothe one with rags.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Listen to your father who begot you, and do not despise your mother when she is old.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Buy truth and do not sell it—wisdom and instruction and understanding.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Do not envy men of evil, nor desire to be with them;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;for violence is in their heart, and their lips speak of trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and by knowledge its rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant wealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;A wise man is strong; and a man of knowledge increases power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For by wise counsel you wage your war, and in the multitude of advisers there is safety.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Wisdom is as precious stones to a fool; in the gate he will not open his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He who devises evil is called a man of schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The devising of foolishness is sin, and the scorner is an abomination to man.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small indeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Rescue those being led away to death; and those staggering to be slain, hold back.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For if you say, “We did not know this,” does He not weigh the hearts? And He who guards your soul knows; and He will repay man according to his work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Eat honey, my son, for it is good; and the honeycomb is sweet to your taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;So know wisdom for your soul; if you have found it, then there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Do not lurk, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; do not plunder his resting-place.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For a righteous man may fall seven times, and rise again; but the wicked stumble in calamity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and do not let your heart be glad when he stumbles,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;lest the LORD see, and it displease Him, and He turn His wrath away from him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Do not fret because of evildoers, and do not envy the wicked;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;for there will be no future for evil men; the lamp of the wicked will be put out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;My son, fear the LORD and the king; do not mingle with those given to change.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For their calamity will rise suddenly, and who knows the disaster of both of them?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;These also are sayings of the wise: to show partiality in judgment is not good.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous”—peoples will curse him, nations will be angry with him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;But to those who correct him there will be delight; and a good blessing will come upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Let lips kiss him who gives a right answer.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Prepare your work outside, and make it ready in the field for yourself; then afterwards build your house.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause; and do not deceive with your lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Do not say, “As he did to me, so will I do to him; I will repay the man according to his work.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;I passed by the field of a lazy man, and by the vineyard of a man without sense;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;and lo, it was all overgrown with thorns; its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Then I looked, and considered; I saw, and received instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;and poverty will come on you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is like clouds and wind without rain.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;By patience a ruler may be persuaded,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;A man who bears false witness against his neighbor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a club, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Trust in an unfaithful man in time of trouble<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a broken tooth and a slipping foot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;One who removes a garment in cold weather,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and vinegar on soda,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is he who sings songs to a heavy heart.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat;<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;The north wind brings forth rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a backbiting tongue an angry face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;It is better to live on the corner of a roof<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a muddied spring and a polluted fountain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;It is not good to eat much honey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor to seek out one’s own glory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;A man without self-control<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sweetness of a friend comes from earnest counsel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;better is a neighbor who is near<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a brother who is far away.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that I may answer him who taunts me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;A prudent man sees danger and hides himself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the simple pass on and suffer for it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Take his garment who is surety for a stranger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take a pledge from him for a foreign woman.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will be counted as a curse to him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;A continual dripping on a rainy day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a quarrelsome woman are alike;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;he who restrains her restrains the wind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grasps oil with his right hand.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Iron sharpens iron,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a man sharpens the face of his friend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;He who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he who guards his master will be honored.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;As water reflects a face,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a man is tested by the praise he receives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Though you crush a fool in a mortar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a pestle along with grain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his folly will not depart from him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Know well the condition of your flock;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set your heart to your herds,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;for wealth is not forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor does a crown endure to all generations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;When the grass disappears and new growth is seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the herbs of the mountains are gathered,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;lambs will provide your clothing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and goats the price of a field;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;and there will be goats’ milk enough for your food,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the food of your household,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sustenance for your maidens.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 28</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The wicked flee when no man pursues,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Because of the transgression of a land its princes are many,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but by a man of understanding and knowledge it endures.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;A poor man who oppresses the weak<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a sweeping rain that destroys crops.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Those who forsake the law praise the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who keep the law contend with them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Evil men do not understand justice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but those who seek the LORD understand everything.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than a perverse man who is rich.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He who keeps the law is a wise son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who keeps company with gluttons disgraces his father.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He who increases his wealth by interest and profit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gathers it for him who shows grace to the poor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He who turns his ear away from hearing the law—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even his prayer is an abomination.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;He who misleads the upright into an evil path<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will fall into his own pit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the blameless will inherit what is good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;A rich man who is wise in his own eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is exposed by poor man with discernment.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;When the righteous triumph, there is great glory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Happy is the man who is always cautious,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hardens his heart will fall into trouble.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;A roaring lion and a charging bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a wicked ruler over a poor people.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;A prince lacking understanding is a great oppressor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;A man burdened with the blood of another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will flee to the pit; let no man support him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;He who walks blamelessly will be delivered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who is crooked in his ways will fall at once.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;He who works his land will have plenty of bread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who pursues worthless things will have plenty of poverty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;A faithful man will abound with blessings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;To show partiality is not good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet for a piece of bread a man will do wrong.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;A man with an evil eye hastens after wealth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not know that want will come upon him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;He who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;than he who flatters with the tongue.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;He who robs his father or his mother and says, “It is no transgression,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a companion to a destroyer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;A greedy man stirs up strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;He who trusts in his own heart is a fool,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who walks in wisdom will escape.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;He who gives to the poor will lack nothing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;When the wicked rise, men hide themselves;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when they perish, the righteous increase.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 29</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;A man who stiffens his neck after many rebukes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will suddenly be broken without remedy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;When the righteous increase, a nation rejoices,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when a wicked man rules, a nation groans.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The man who loves wisdom makes his father glad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but one who keeps company with prostitutes squanders his wealth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;By justice a king establishes a land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man who takes bribes tears it down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;A man who flatters his neighbor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spreads a net for his feet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;In the transgression of a wicked man there is a snare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a righteous man sings and rejoices.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;A righteous man cares for the cause of the poor,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the wise turn away wrath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;When a wise man disputes with a fool,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the fool rages or laughs, and there is no rest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Men of blood hate one who is blameless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the upright seek his life to protect it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;A fool gives full vent to his spirit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a wise man quietly holds it back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;If a ruler listens to lies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all his servants become wicked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The poor man and the oppressor meet together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD gives light to the eyes of both.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;If a king judges the poor with truth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his throne will be established forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;A rod and reproof give wisdom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;When the wicked increase, transgression increases,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the righteous will look on their downfall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Discipline your son, and he will give you rest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will give delight to your soul.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Where there is no vision, a man casts off restraint,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but he who keeps the law is blessed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;A servant will not be corrected by words,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he understands, yet he will not respond.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Do you see a man hasty in his words?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is more hope for a fool than for him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;If a man pampers his servant from youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the end that servant will act as a son.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;A man of anger stirs up strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a hot-tempered man commits many transgressions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;A man’s pride brings him low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but a man of lowly spirit will obtain honor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Whoever shares with a thief hates his own life;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he hears the oath to testify but says nothing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;The fear of man lays a snare,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but whoever trusts in the LORD is set secure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Many seek the face of a ruler,<br>

    <h2>Chapter 30</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The words of Agur son of Jakeh—the utterance:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man declares "I am weary, O God, I am weary and tired."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Surely I am more brutish than any man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I do not have a man’s understanding.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I have not learned wisdom,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor do I know the knowledge of the Holy One.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Who has gone up to heaven and come back down?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has gathered the wind in his fists?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has wrapped the seas in a garment?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has established all the ends of the earth?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is his name, and what is his son’s name? Don't you know?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Every word of God is refined;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Do not add to his words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest he reprove you and you be found a liar.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Two things I ask of you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not withhold them from me before I die:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Remove falsehood and lying far from me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give me neither poverty nor riches—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feed me with the food allotted to me,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;lest I become full and deny you and say, “Who is the LORD?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or lest I become poor and steal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and profane the name of my God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Do not slander a servant to his master,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest he curse you and you be found guilty.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;There is a generation that curses its father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not bless its mother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet is not washed from its filth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;There is a generation—how lofty are their eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their eyelids are lifted high.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;There is a generation whose teeth are swords<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose jaw teeth are knives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to devour the afflicted from the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the needy from among men.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The leech has two daughters: “Give” and “Give.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three things are never satisfied;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;four never say, “Enough”:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;the grave, and the barren womb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth that is never filled with water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fire that never says, “Enough.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;The eye that mocks a father<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and scorns obedience to a mother—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ravens of the valley will pluck it out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the young eagles will eat it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Three things are too wondrous for me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and four I do not understand:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;the way of an eagle in the sky,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way of a serpent on a rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way of a ship in the heart of the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the way of a man with a young woman.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;This is the way of an adulterous woman:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she eats and wipes her mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and says, “I have done no wrong.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Under three things the earth trembles,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and under four it cannot bear up:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;under a servant when he becomes king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a fool when he is satisfied with food,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;under a hated woman when she gets a husband,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Four things on the earth are small,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they are exceedingly wise:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;the ants are a people not strong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet they prepare their food in the summer;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;the rock badgers are not a mighty people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet they make their house in the cliffs;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;the locusts have no king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet they all march in ranks;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;the lizard you can grasp with your hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet it is in kings’ palaces.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Three things have a stately stride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and four are stately in their walk:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;the lion, mighty among beasts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does not turn back from anything;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;the strutting rooster, or the he-goat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a king when his army is with him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;If you have been foolish in exalting yourself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or if you have devised evil, put your hand to your mouth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;For pressing milk produces curds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pressing the nose produces blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pressing anger produces strife.<br></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor your ways to those who destroy kings.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;It is not for kings, O Lemuel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not for kings to drink wine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor for rulers to crave strong drink,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;lest he drink and forget what is decreed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pervert the justice of any of the afflicted.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Give strong drink to the one who is perishing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and wine to those bitter of soul;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;let him drink and forget his poverty,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Open your mouth for the mute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the rights of all who are passing away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Open your mouth, judge righteously,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and defend the poor and needy.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;A woman of valor, who can find her?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her worth is far beyond rubies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The heart of her husband trusts in her,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;She opens her hand to the poor<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and reaches out her hands to the needy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;She is not afraid for her household because of snow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all her household are clothed in scarlet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;She makes coverings for herself;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and she laughs at the days to come.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;She opens her mouth with wisdom,<br>
