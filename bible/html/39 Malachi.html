    <h1>Malachi</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The oracle of the word of the LORD to Israel by the hand of Malachi.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;“I have loved you,” says the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say, “How have You loved us?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” declares the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Yet I loved Jacob,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;but Esau I hated.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made his mountains a desolation<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave his inheritance to the jackals of the wilderness.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;If Edom says, “We are shattered,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but we will rebuild the ruins,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thus says the LORD of hosts:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“They may build, but I will tear down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will be called ‘The Wicked Territory,’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ‘The people with whom the LORD is angry forever.’”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Your eyes shall see this, and you shall say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Great is the LORD beyond the border of Israel!”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;A son honors his father,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a servant, his master.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If then I am a father, where is My honor?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I am a master, where is My fear?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O priests who despise My name.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say, “How have we despised Your name?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;You offer defiled food on My altar.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say, “How have we defiled You?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By saying that the table of the LORD is to be despised.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;When you present the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you present the lame and the sick, is it not evil?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring it now to your governor—will he be pleased with you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or show you favor? says the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;And now, entreat the favor of God, that He may be gracious to us.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such a gift from your hand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will He show favor to any of you? says the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Oh that there were one among you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who would shut the doors,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that you might not kindle fire on My altar in vain!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no pleasure in you, says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will not accept an offering from your hand.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;For from the rising of the sun to its setting,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name will be great among the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in every place incense is offered to My name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a pure offering.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For My name will be great among the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;But you profane it when you say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The table of the LORD is defiled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its fruit—that is, its food—is to be despised.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But you say, “Look, what a weariness this is,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you sniff at it, says the LORD of hosts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You bring what has been taken by violence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or is lame or sick—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this you bring as an offering!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall I accept this from your hand? says the LORD.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Cursed be the deceiver who has a male in his flock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and vows it, yet sacrifices to the LORD what is blemished.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am a great King, says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and My name will be feared among the nations.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And now, O priests, this command is for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;If you will not listen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if you will not put it in your heart to honor My name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then I will send a curse upon you.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will even curse your blessings;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed, I have already cursed them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because you do not lay it to heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;See, I will rebuke your offspring,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and spread dung on your faces,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the dung of your festival offerings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you shall be taken away with it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;So you shall know that I have sent this command to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that My covenant with Levi may stand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;My covenant with him was one of life and peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I gave them to him for fear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he feared Me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he stood in awe of My name.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;True instruction was in his mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no injustice was found on his lips.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked with Me in peace and uprightness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he turned many from iniquity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For the lips of a priest should guard knowledge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and men should seek instruction from his mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for he is the messenger of the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But you have turned aside from the way;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have caused many to stumble by your instruction.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have corrupted the covenant of Levi,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;So I make you despised and low<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before all the people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;inasmuch as you do not keep My ways<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but show partiality in your instruction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Have we not all one father?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has not one God created us?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why then are we faithless to one another,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;profaning the covenant of our fathers?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Judah has been faithless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the LORD, which He loves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has married the daughter of a foreign god.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;May the LORD cut off from the tents of Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any man who does this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brings an offering to the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And this second thing you do:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cover the altar of the LORD with tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with weeping and groaning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because He no longer regards the offering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or accepts it with favor from your hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;But you say, “Why doesn't He?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the LORD was witness between you and the wife of your youth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to whom you have been faithless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Did He not make them one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a portion of the Spirit in their union?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what was the one God seeking?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Godly offspring.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So guard yourselves in your spirit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and let none of you be faithless to the wife of your youth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;“For I hate divorce,” says the LORD, the God of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“and him who covers his garment with violence,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So guard yourselves in your spirit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not be faithless.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;You have wearied the LORD with your words.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say, “How have we wearied Him?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He delights in them,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or by asking, “Where is the God of justice?”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Behold, I am sending My messenger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he will prepare the way before Me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;behold, He is coming,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;But who can endure the day of His coming,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and who can stand when He appears?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For He is like a refiner’s fire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like fullers’ soap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He will purify the sons of Levi<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refine them like gold and silver,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the LORD.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as in the days of old and as in former years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Then I will draw near to you for judgment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the adulterers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against those who swear falsely,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against those who oppress the hired worker in his wages,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the widow and the orphan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against those who turn aside the foreigner and do not fear Me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For I, the LORD, do not change;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from My statutes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have not kept them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return to Me, and I will return to you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say, “How shall we return?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Will a man rob God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet you are robbing Me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say, “How have we robbed You?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tithes and offerings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;You are cursed with a curse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you are robbing Me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole nation of you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Bring the full tithe into the storehouse,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that there may be food in My house.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And test Me now in this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I will not open the windows of heaven for you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and pour down for you a blessing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;until there is no more need.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;I will rebuke the devourer for you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Then all the nations will call you blessed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for you will be a land of delight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Your words have been harsh against Me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say, “What have we spoken against You?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;You have said, “It is vain to serve God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the profit of our keeping His charge<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or of walking as mourners before the LORD of hosts?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And now we call the arrogant blessed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evildoers not only prosper<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they put God to the test and they escape.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Then those who feared the LORD spoke with one another.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD paid attention and heard them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a book of remembrance was written before Him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of those who feared the LORD and esteemed His name.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;“They shall be Mine,” says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“in the day when I make up My treasured possession,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Then once more you shall see the distinction<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between the righteous and the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between one who serves God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and one who does not serve Him.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when all the arrogant and all evildoers will be stubble.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day that is coming shall set them ablaze,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;But for you who fear My name,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You shall go out leaping like calves from the stall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;And you shall tread down the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the day when I act,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;says the LORD of hosts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Remember the law of My servant Moses,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the statutes and judgments that I commanded him at Horeb<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all Israel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before the great and awesome day of the LORD comes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the sons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the hearts of the sons to their fathers.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse.<br></p>
