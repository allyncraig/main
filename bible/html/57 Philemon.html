    <h1>The Epistle of Paul to Philemon</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets in your house:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;I give thanks to my God always when I remember you in my prayers,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;because I hear of your love and the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;so that the fellowship of your faith may become effective in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For I have had much joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, though I have much boldness in Christ to command you to do what is proper,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;yet for love’s sake I appeal to you—being such a one as Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;I appeal to you concerning my child Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my imprisonment,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;who formerly was useless to you but now is useful both to you and to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;I am sending him back to you, that is, my very heart,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;whom I wanted to keep with me, so that on your behalf he might serve me in my imprisonment for the gospel.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;But without your consent I did not want to do anything, so that your goodness might not be by compulsion but by free will.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a time, so that you might have him back forever,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;no longer as a slave but more than a slave, a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;If, then, you consider me a partner, receive him as you would me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And if he has wronged you in anything or owes you anything, charge that to my account.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it. Not to mention that you owe me your very self besides.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Yes, brother, may I have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;And at the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
