    <h1>The First Epistle of Paul to the Thessalonians</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: grace to you and peace.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;We give thanks to God always for all of you, making mention of you in our prayers,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ before our God and Father.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For we know, brothers beloved by God, your election,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction—just as you know what sort of men we proved to be among you for your sake.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word with the joy of the Holy Spirit while under persecution,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For from you the word of the Lord has sounded forth not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we have no need to say anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For they themselves report about us what sort of reception we had with you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead—Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;But after we had already suffered and been shamefully treated in Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to speak to you the gospel of God amid much conflict.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For our exhortation did not come from error or uncleanness, nor by way of deceit;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;rather, just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak—not as pleasing men, but God who examines our hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For we never came with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed—God is our witness—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;nor did we seek glory from men, either from you or from others, even though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But we became gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother cherishes her own children.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;So, having deep affection for you, we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For you remember, brothers, our labor and hardship: working night and day so as not to be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and righteously and blamelessly we behaved toward you who believe—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;just as you know how, like a father with his own children,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And because of this, we also constantly thank God, that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it truly is—the word of God, which also is at work in you who believe.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, for you also suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and are not pleasing to God, and are hostile to all men,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved—so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But wrath has come upon them to the uttermost.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;But we, brothers, having been torn away from you for a short time—in person, not in heart—were all the more eager with great desire to see your face.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, more than once—and Satan hindered us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not indeed you?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;For you are our glory and joy.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;So when we could no longer endure it, we thought it best to be left behind in Athens alone,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and we sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you in regard to your faith,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions. For you yourselves know that we were appointed to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And indeed, when we were with you, we kept telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction, just as it happened—which you know.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor might be in vain.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;But now Timothy has just come to us from you and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always remember us kindly and long to see us—just as we also long to see you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Because of this, brothers, we were comforted in you through your faith in all our distress and affliction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For what thanks can we render to God for you in return for all the joy with which we rejoice before our God because of you?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Night and day we keep praying most earnestly to see your face and to complete what is lacking in your faith.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;and may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow in love for one another and for all men, just as we also do for you,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Finally, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God—just as you are doing—that you do so more and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For this is the will of God: your sanctification—that you abstain from sexual immorality,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;that each man among you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;No man should transgress and take advantage of his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, just as we told you before and solemnly warned you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For God has not called us to impurity but to holiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, the one who rejects this is not rejecting man but God, who gives His Holy Spirit to you.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Now concerning brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Indeed, you are doing this toward all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to excel even more&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;and to aspire to live quietly, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, just as we instructed you,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;so that you may walk properly before outsiders and not be dependent on anyone.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, so that you may not grieve like the rest who have no hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with Him those who have fallen asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;For this we say to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Then we who remain alive will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, comfort one another with these words.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need for anything to be written to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;When they say, “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction will come upon them like labor pains upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that the day should surprise you like a thief.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For you are all sons of light and sons of day; we are not of night nor of darkness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;So then, let us not sleep as the rest do, but let us be alert and sober.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But since we are of the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For God has not destined us for wrath, but for obtaining salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;who died for us, so that whether we are awake or asleep, we might live together with Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Now we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and who are over you in the Lord and admonish you,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Rejoice always,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;pray without ceasing,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;give thanks in everything; for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Do not quench the Spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Do not despise prophecies,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;but test all things; hold fast to what is good.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Abstain from every form of evil.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;The one who calls you is faithful, and He will surely do it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Brothers, pray for us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;I charge you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
