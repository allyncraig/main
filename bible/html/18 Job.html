    <h1>The Book of Job</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, fearing God and turning away from evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Seven sons and three daughters were born to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;His possessions were 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and a very large household; and that man was greater than all the men of the east.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his appointed day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;When the days of feasting had run their course, Job would send for them and consecrate them; he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all, for Job said, “Perhaps my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Thus Job did continually.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and the Adversary also came among them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Then Satan answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The LORD said to Satan, “Have you set your mind on My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Satan answered the LORD and said, “Does Job fear God for nothing?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Have You not put a hedge around him, and around his house, and around all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But stretch out Your hand and strike all that he has, and surely he will curse You to Your face.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The LORD said to Satan, “All that he has is in your power; only do not stretch out your hand against him.” So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Now it happened on the day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;that a messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were feeding beside them,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them away; they also struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;While he was still speaking, another came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;While he was still speaking, another came and said, “Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;and suddenly a great wind came from across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head, and he fell to the ground and worshiped.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;He said,</p>

    <p>“Naked I came from my mother’s womb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and naked I shall return there.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blessed be the name of the LORD.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with wrongdoing.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The LORD said to Satan, “From where do you come?” Satan answered the LORD and said, “From roaming about on the earth and walking around on it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The LORD said to Satan, “Have you set your mind on My servant Job? For there is no one like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, fearing God and turning away from evil. He still holds firmly to his integrity, though you incited Me against him to destroy him without cause.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Satan answered the LORD and said, “Skin for skin! Indeed, all that a man has he will give for his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;But stretch out Your hand now and strike his bone and his flesh, and surely he will curse You to Your face.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;The LORD said to Satan, “Behold, he is in your power; only spare his life.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with painful boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He took a potsherd to scrape himself while he sat among the ashes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Then his wife said to him, “Do you still hold fast to your integrity? Curse God and die!”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;But he said to her, “You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Should we indeed accept good from God and not accept adversity?” In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each came from his own place—Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They met together to come to sympathize with him and to comfort him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;When they lifted up their eyes from a distance, they did not recognize him, and they raised their voices and wept; each tore his robe, and they threw dust into the air and upon their heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;They sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his pain was very great.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Job spoke and said:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;“May the day perish on which I was born,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the night that said, ‘A man is conceived.’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;May that day be darkness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may God above not seek it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor light shine upon it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;May darkness and deep shadow reclaim it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may a cloud settle upon it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may blackness of the day terrify it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;As for that night, may thick darkness seize it;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may it not rejoice among the days of the year;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may it not enter the number of the months.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Yes, may that night be barren;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may no joyful shout come into it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Let those curse it who curse the day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who are ready to rouse Leviathan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;May the stars of its dawn be dark;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may it hope for light and have none,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor see the eyelids of the morning,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;because it did not shut the doors of my mother’s womb,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor hide trouble from my eyes.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Why did I not die at birth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come forth from the womb and expire?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Why did knees receive me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or why were there breasts to nurse me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;For now I would have lain down and been quiet;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have slept; then I would be at rest<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;with kings and counselors of the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who build only ruins for themselves,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;or with princes who had gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who filled their houses with silver.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Or like a miscarriage hidden away, I would not exist,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as infants who never saw the light.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;There the wicked cease from troubling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there the weary find rest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Prisoners are at ease together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;The small and the great are there,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the slave is free from his master.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Why is light given to him who suffers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and life to the bitter in soul,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;who long for death, but it does not come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;who rejoice exceedingly,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are glad when they find the grave?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whom God has hedged in?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;For my sighing comes instead of my food,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my groanings pour out like water.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;For what I fear comes upon me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and what I dread befalls me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;I am not at ease, nor am I quiet;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no rest, but turmoil comes.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;“If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet who can keep from speaking?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Yes, you have instructed many,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you have strengthened weak hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Your words have upheld him who was stumbling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you have made feeble knees firm.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;But now it has come to you, and you are weary;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it touches you, and you are dismayed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Is not your fear of God your confidence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the integrity of your ways, your hope?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Remember now: who among the innocent ever perished?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or where were the upright cut off?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;As I have seen, those who plow iniquity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sow trouble reap the same.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;By the breath of God they perish,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the teeth of the young lions are broken.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;The strong lion perishes for lack of prey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Now a word was brought to me stealthily;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ear received a whisper of it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Amid disquieting thoughts from visions of the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when deep sleep falls on men,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;dread came upon me and trembling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which made all my bones shake.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Then a spirit passed before my face;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the hair of my flesh stood on end.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a form was before my eyes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there was silence, then I heard a voice:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;‘Can mortal man be right before God?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can a man be pure before his Maker?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;You will see how He puts no trust even in His servants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He charges His angels with error;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;how much more those who dwell in houses of clay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose foundation is in the dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who are crushed like a moth!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Between morning and evening they are broken to pieces;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without anyone regarding it, they perish forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Is not their tent cord pulled up within them?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They die without wisdom.’”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;“Call now! Will anyone answer you?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to which of the holy ones will you turn?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For vexation kills the fool,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and jealousy slays the simple.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I have seen the fool taking root,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I cursed his dwelling immediately.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;His sons are far from safety;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they allow themselves to be destroyed at the city gates,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is no deliverer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The hungry eat his harvest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take it even out of the thorns,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For affliction does not come from the dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor does trouble sprout from the ground;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;but man is born to trouble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as sparks fly upward.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But as for me, I would seek God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to God I would commit my cause,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;who does great and unsearchable things,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wonders without number.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;He gives rain on the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sends water on the fields,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;to set the lowly on high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who mourn are lifted to safety.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;He frustrates the devices of the crafty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;He catches the wise in their own craftiness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the counsel of the wily is swiftly ended.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;They meet with darkness in the daytime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grope at noonday as in the night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;But He saves the needy from the sword in their mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from a strong hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;So the poor have hope,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and injustice shuts its mouth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;How blessed is the man whom God corrects;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore do not despise the discipline of the Almighty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For He wounds, but He also binds up;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strikes, but His hands heal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;In six troubles He will deliver you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in seven no evil shall touch you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;In famine He will redeem you from death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in war from the power of the sword.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall not fear destruction when it comes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;At destruction and famine you shall laugh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;For you shall have a covenant with the stones of the field,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;You shall know that your tent is at peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you shall visit your fold and find nothing missing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;You shall know also that your offspring shall be many,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your descendants like the grass of the earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;You shall come to the grave in ripe old age,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a sheaf gathered up in its season.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Yes, this we have searched out; it is true.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen to it, and know it for yourself.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Then Job answered and said:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;“Oh that my grief were fully weighed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my calamity laid in the balances together!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For then it would be heavier than the sand of the seas;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore my words have been rash.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For the arrows of the Almighty are in me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my spirit drinks their poison;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the terrors of God are arrayed against me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or does the ox low over his fodder?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or is there any flavor in the white of an egg?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;My soul refuses to touch them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are loathsome food to me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Oh that my request might come to pass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that God would grant my desire,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;that it would please God to crush me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that He would loose His hand and cut me off!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;This would still be my comfort;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would exult in pain unsparing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;What is my strength, that I should wait?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is my end, that I should be patient?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Is my strength the strength of stones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or is my flesh bronze?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Is it not that there is no help within me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that deliverance is driven from me?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;He who withholds kindness from a friend<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forsakes the fear of the Almighty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;My brothers have dealt deceitfully like a wadi,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like seasonal torrents that abate quickly,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;which are dark because of ice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in which the snow hides itself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;When they thaw, they vanish;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it is hot, they disappear from their place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;The paths of their course wind along;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they go up into the wasteland and perish.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;The caravans of Tema look;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the travelers of Sheba hope for them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;They are disappointed because they were confident;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they come there and are confounded.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For now you are nothing;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you see terror and are afraid.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Have I said, ‘Give to me’?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, ‘Offer a gift for me from your wealth’?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Or, ‘Deliver me from the hand of the adversary’?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless’?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Teach me, and I will be silent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make me understand how I have gone astray.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;How painful are honest words!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what does your argument prove?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Do you intend to correct my words,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the words of a despairing man are like the wind?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;You would even cast lots for the orphan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bargain over your friend.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;But now be pleased to look at me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I will not lie to your face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Turn, I pray, let there be no injustice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Return again to me, my cause is righteous.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Is there injustice on my tongue?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can my palate not discern calamity?”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;“Does not man have hard service on earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and are not his days like those of a hired hand?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Like a slave who longs for the shadow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and like a hired man who looks for his wages,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;so I have been allotted months of futility,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and nights of misery have been appointed to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;When I lie down I say, ‘When shall I arise?’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the night is long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am full of tossing till the dawn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and come to an end without hope.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Remember that my life is but a breath;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my eye will never again see good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your eyes will be upon me, but I shall be gone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;As the cloud fades and vanishes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so he who goes down to the grave does not come up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;He returns no more to his house,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor does his place know him any longer.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Therefore I will not restrain my mouth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Am I the sea, or a sea monster,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that You set a guard over me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;When I say, ‘My bed will comfort me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my couch will ease my complaint,’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;then You frighten me with dreams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and terrify me with visions,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;so that I would choose strangling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or death over my wasting bones.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;I loathe my life; I would not live forever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave me alone, for my days are a breath.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;What is man that You make much of him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that You set Your heart on him,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;and visit him every morning,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and test him every moment?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;How long will You not look away from me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor leave me alone till I swallow my spittle?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;If I have sinned, what have I done to You,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O watcher of mankind?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why have You made me Your target,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that I am a burden to myself?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Why then do You not pardon my transgression<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and take away my iniquity?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now I shall lie down in the dust;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will seek me, but I shall be no more.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has hardened himself against Him and prospered?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;He who removes mountains, and they do not know it,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that its pillars tremble;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;who commands the sun, and it does not rise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and seals up the stars;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;who alone stretches out the heavens<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and treads upon the waves of the sea;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;who made the Bear and Orion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Pleiades and the chambers of the south;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;who does great things beyond searching out,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;How then can I answer Him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;choosing my words with Him?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Though I am in the right, I could not answer;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not believe that He was listening to my voice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For He crushes me with a tempest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and multiplies my wounds without cause.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;He will not allow me to catch my breath,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though I am blameless, He will prove me crooked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;I am blameless; I care not for myself;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put off my sad face and be cheerful,’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;I become afraid of all my sorrows,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for I know that You will not hold me innocent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;I shall be condemned;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who might lay his hand upon us both.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Let Him remove His rod from me,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their children dance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;They lift up the tambourine and harp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rejoice at the sound of the flute.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;They spend their days in prosperity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in a moment go down into the grave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Yet they say to God, “Depart from us,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for we do not desire the knowledge of Your ways.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him?<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;See, their prosperity is not under their own control;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Him repay him, that he may know it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Let his own eyes see his destruction,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and worms cover them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Look, I know your thoughts,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And where is the tent in which the wicked lived?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Have you not asked those who travel the roads?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you not recognize their witnesses,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;that the wicked is spared in the day of calamity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that he is delivered in the day of wrath?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Who declares his way to his face?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who repays him for what he has done?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;He is carried to the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and men keep watch over his tomb.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;The clods of the valley are sweet to him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all men follow after him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who went before are without number.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;How then do you comfort me with emptiness,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turns to the right, but I do not see Him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;But He knows the way that I take;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the desert yields food for them and for their children.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;They reap in a field that is not theirs,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by His light I walked through darkness;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;as I was in the days of my prime,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when God’s friendship rested on my tent,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;when the Almighty was still with me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my children were around me,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;when my steps were washed with cream,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rock poured out streams of oil for me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;When I went out to the gate of the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I took my seat in the square,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;young men saw me and withdrew,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the aged rose and stood;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;princes restrained their words<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and laid a hand over their mouths;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;the voice of nobles was hushed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their tongue clung to the roof of their mouth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;For the ear that heard me blessed me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the eye that saw me approved,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;because I delivered the poor who cried for help,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fatherless who had none to assist him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The blessing of the one who was perishing came upon me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I clothed myself with righteousness, and it clothed me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my justice was like a robe and a turban.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;I was eyes to the blind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and feet to the lame.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;I was a father to the needy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I examined the case of the stranger.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;I broke the fangs of the wicked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and snatched the prey from his teeth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Then I said, ‘I will die in my nest,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will multiply my days like the sand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;My root is spread out to the waters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the dew lies all night on my branch.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;My glory is fresh in me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my bow is renewed in my hand.’</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;They listened to me and waited,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and kept silence for my counsel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;After I spoke, they did not speak again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my speech dropped on them like dew.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;They waited for me as for the rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and opened their mouth wide as for the spring rain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;I smiled on them when they had no confidence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they were not discouraged by the light of my face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;I chose their way and sat as their chief;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dwelled as a king among the troops,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as one who comforts mourners.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 32</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;So these three men ceased answering Job,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he was righteous in his own eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Then the anger of Elihu, son of Barakel the Buzite,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the family of Ram, burned against Job;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his was angry because he justified himself rather than God.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He was incensed against his three friends as well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they could not answer Job,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;though they had condemned him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they were older than he.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;But when Elihu saw that there was no answer<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mouth of the three men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his anger burned.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;So Elihu, son of Barakel the Buzite, spoke up and said:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I am young in years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and you are old;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore I was timid and afraid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to declare my opinion to you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;I said, ‘Let days speak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and many years teach wisdom.’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But it is the spirit in man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the breath of the Almighty, that gives understanding.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;It is not the great in years who are wise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor the aged who understand justice.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also will declare my knowledge.’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;You saw how I waited for your words;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I listened to your reasoning<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while you searched out what to say.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And I paid close attention to you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but none of you proved Job wrong,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none could respond to his words.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Do not say, ‘We have found wisdom;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God will defeat him, not man.’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;But he has not directed his argument against me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will I answer him with your speeches.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;They are dismayed; they answer no more;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;words have deserted them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;And shall I wait because they do not speak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they stand still and answer no longer?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;I also will answer my share;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also will declare my knowledge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For I am full of words;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the spirit within me presses me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Look, my belly is like wine that has no vent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like new wineskins it is ready to burst.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;I must speak, that I may find relief;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must open my lips and answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Let me not show partiality to any man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor flatter any man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For I do not know how to flatter;<br>

    <h2>Chapter 33</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;“But now, Job, hear my speech,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yet man does not perceive it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;In a dream, a vision of the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when deep sleep falls upon men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as they slumber on their beds,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;then He opens the ears of men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and seals their instruction,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;to turn man from his deeds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and keep pride from him,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;to spare his soul from the pit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his life from passing by the sword.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Or he is chastened with pain on his bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with continual strife in his bones,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;so that his life loathes bread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his soul his favorite food.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;His flesh wastes away so that it cannot be seen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his bones, once hidden, stick out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;His soul draws near the pit,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his life to those who bring death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;If there is for him an angel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mediator, one out of a thousand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to declare to man what is right for him,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;then He is gracious to him and says,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will you condemn the righteous, the mighty One,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;who says to a king, ‘Worthless,’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to nobles, ‘Wicked’?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;He does not show partiality to princes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor regard the rich over the poor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for all of them are the work of His hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;They die in a moment;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at midnight a people are shaken and pass away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the mighty are taken away without a hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For His eyes are upon the ways of man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He sees all his steps.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;There is neither darkness nor deep shadow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where workers of iniquity could hide themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;For He does not set a time for any man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to go before God in judgment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;He shatters mighty men without inquiry<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sets others in their place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Therefore He knows their works,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overturning them in the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they are crushed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;He strikes them like wicked men<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a place where onlookers see,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;because they turned aside from following Him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not understand any of His ways,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to Him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He hears the cry of the afflicted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;When He is quiet, who can condemn?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When He hides His face, who can see Him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whether it concerns a nation or a man alike,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;so that a godless man should not rule,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that there be no snares for the people?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;For has anyone said to God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘I have borne chastisement; I will not offend again;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;teach me what I do not see;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if I have done iniquity, I will not do it again’?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Should He repay according to your mind, since you reject it?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For you must choose, and not I;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so declare what you know.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Men of understanding will say to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a wise man who hears me will say,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;‘Job speaks without knowledge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his words are without insight.’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;Would that Job were tried to the utmost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because he answers like wicked men.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;For he adds rebellion to his sin;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he claps his hands among us<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and multiplies his words against God.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 35</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Elihu answered and said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Do you think this is just, that you say,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“My righteousness is more than God’s”?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For you ask, “What advantage is it to You?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What greater benefit do I gain than if I had sinned?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;I will answer you, and your companions with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Look up to the heavens and observe;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look at the skies, which are higher than you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;If you have sinned, what does that do to Him?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if your transgressions are many,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how does that affect Him?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;If you are righteous,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what do you give Him?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or what does He receive from your hand?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Your wickedness only affects a man like yourself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your righteousness a son of man.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Because of the multitude of oppressions they cry out;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they call for help because of the power of the mighty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;But no one says, “Where is God my Maker,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who gives songs in the night,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and makes us wiser than the birds of heaven?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;There they cry, but He gives no answer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the pride of evil men.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Surely God will not hear vanity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will the Almighty regard it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Yes, even if you say you do not see Him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your case is still before Him, so wait for Him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And now, because He has not visited<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His anger upon you;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neither considered your great wickedness,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;you have opened your mouth in vanity;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you multiply words without knowledge."<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 36</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Elihu continued and said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Wait a little, and I will show you — there are yet words to say on God’s behalf.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I will draw my knowledge from afar; I will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Look — God is mighty, yet He despises no one; He is mighty in power of understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He does not preserve the life of the wicked, but gives justice to the afflicted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He does not remove His eyes from the righteous; He exalts them with kings, and they dwell in honor forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;But if someone is bound in chains, held fast in cords of affliction,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;he tells them what they have done — that they have sinned arrogantly;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;he makes them listen to correction, and commands that they turn from iniquity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;If they obey and serve Him, they will spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;But if they do not obey, then they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;They die in their youth, among the revelers and prostitutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Yet He rescues those who suffer in their affliction; He speaks to them in their distress.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;He draws you from the jaws of distress into a broad place free from restriction, to a table spread with abundance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Yet you are full of judgment due to your wickedness; wrath and justice seize you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Beware that riches do not entice you, and that a large bribe does not turn you aside.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Can your wealth keep you from distress, or all your mighty efforts from hard times?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Beware of turning to evil, which you seem to prefer to affliction.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Look — God is exalted by His power; who is a teacher like Him?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Who has prescribed His way for Him, or said, “You have done wrong”?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Remember to praise His work, of which men have sung.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;All mankind has looked on it; men gaze on it from afar.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;How great is God — beyond our understanding! The number of His years is unsearchable.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;He draws up the drops of water, which distill as rain for the streams;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;the clouds pour down their moisture, and abundant showers fall on man.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Who can understand the spreading of clouds, or the thunder from His pavilion?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Look — He spreads His lightning about Him, and covers the depths of the sea.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;This is how He governs — by His power He provides food in abundance.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;He fills His hands with lightning, and commands it to strike its mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;His thunder proclaims it; even the cattle tell of the storm’s approach.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 37</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;At this my heart trembles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and leaps out of its place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Listen closely to the rumble of His voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sound that comes from His mouth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He lets it loose under all the heavens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and His lightning to the ends of the earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;After it a roar sounds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thunders with His majestic voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He does not restrain the flashes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when His voice is heard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;God thunders wondrously with His voice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does great things that we cannot understand.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For He says to the snow, “Fall on the earth,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the downpour of rain, “Become mighty.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;He seals the hand of every man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that all men may know His work.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Then the beast goes into its den<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stays in its lair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The storm-wind comes from its chamber,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the cold from the scattering winds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;By the breath of God the ice is formed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the wide waters are frozen tight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He loads the thick cloud with moisture;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lightning scatters the cloud.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;It turns around by His guidance,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to perform all that He commands them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the face of the inhabited world.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Whether as a rod, or for His land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or for loyal love, He causes it to happen.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Listen to this, Job;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stand still and consider the wonders of God.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Do you know how God commands them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and causes His lightning to flash?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Do you know the balancing of the clouds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;You whose garments are hot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the land is still because of the south wind,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;can you spread out the sky with Him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as strong as a cast metal mirror?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Teach us what we should say to Him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we cannot arrange our words because of darkness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Should it be told Him that I want to speak?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would a man say such a thing and be swallowed up?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Now men cannot look at the bright light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when it is in the clouds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the wind has passed and cleared them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;From the north comes a golden radiance;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around God is awesome majesty.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;The Almighty — we cannot find Him out;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is exalted in power;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will not violate justice and great righteousness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Therefore men fear Him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not regard any who are wise in their own heart.<br></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his limbs are like bars of iron.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;He is the first of the ways of God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only his Maker can draw near with a sword.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;For the mountains yield food for him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the beasts of the field play there.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;He lies under the lotus plants,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hidden in the reeds and the marsh.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The lotus plants cover him with their shade;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the poplars of the river surround him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Look, if the river rages, he is not alarmed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is confident, though the Jordan should surge against his mouth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Shall anyone capture him with open eyes,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pierce his nose with snares?"<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 41</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;“Can you draw out Leviathan with a hook,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or press down his tongue with a cord?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Can you put a rope in his nose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or pierce his jaw with a hook?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Will he make many requests of you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or will he speak gentle words to you?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Will he make a covenant with you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that you may take him as a servant forever?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Will you play with him as with a bird,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or tie him up for your young women?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Will partners bargain over him?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they divide him among the merchants?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Can you fill his hide with harpoons,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or his head with fishing spears?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Lay your hand on him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will remember the battle and do it no more.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Any hope of subduing him is false;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the mere sight of him is overwhelming.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;No one is fierce enough to rouse him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who then can stand before me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Who has confronted me that I should repay him?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever is under all heaven is mine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;I will not keep silent about his limbs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his mighty strength, and the grace of his form.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Who can strip off his outer covering?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who can penetrate his double armor?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Who can open the doors of his face?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around his teeth is terror.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;His back has rows of shields,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shut up closely as with a seal.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;One is so near to another<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that no air comes between them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;They are joined one to another;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they clasp each other and cannot be separated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;His sneezes flash forth light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Firebrands come forth from his mouth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sparks of fire leap out.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Smoke goes out of his nostrils<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;His breath kindles coals,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and flame comes out of his mouth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Strength resides in his neck,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dismay dances before him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;The folds of his flesh stick together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;firmly cast upon him and immovable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;His heart is hard as stone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hard as the lower millstone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;When he rises up, the mighty are afraid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of his crashings they are beside themselves.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;The sword that reaches him has no effect,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor does spear, dart, or javelin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;He regards iron as straw<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and bronze as rotten wood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;The arrow does not make him flee;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slingstones are turned to stubble for him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Clubs are regarded as stubble;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he laughs at the shaking of the javelin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;His underparts are sharp potsherds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he spreads out a threshing-sledge on the mire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;He makes the deep churn like a pot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Behind him he leaves a shining wake;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one would think the deep had white hair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;On earth there is nothing like him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made without fear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;He looks on all who are lofty;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he is king over all the sons of pride.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 42</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Then Job answered the LORD and said:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;“I know that you can do everything,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and no purpose of yours can be thwarted.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;You said, ‘Who is this who darkens counsel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without knowledge?’<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore I declared what I did not understand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;things too wondrous for me, which I did not know.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will question you, and you will make me know.’<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but now my eye has seen you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Therefore I despise myself,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I repent in dust and ashes.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And after the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, “My wrath is burning against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken what is right about me, as my servant Job has.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;So now take for yourselves seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves, and my servant Job will pray for you, for I will accept him so that I do not deal with you according to your folly, for you have not spoken what is right about me, as my servant Job has.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Then the LORD restored what Job had lost when he prayed for his friends, and the LORD increased all that Job had twofold.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And all his brothers, all his sisters, and all who had known him before came to him and ate a meal with him in his house, and they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the trouble the LORD had brought upon him, and each one gave him money and a gold ring.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning, and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And he had seven sons and three daughters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;And he called the name of the first Jemimah, the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And no women were found in all the land as beautiful as the daughters of Job, and their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;After these events Job lived another 140 years, and he saw his sons and his grandsons, four generations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And Job died, old and full of days.</p>
