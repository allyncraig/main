    <h1>The Psalms</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Blessed is the man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor stand in the way of sinners,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor sit in the seat of scoffers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;But his delight is in the law of the Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and on His law he meditates day and night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He is like a tree planted by streams of water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which produces fruit in due season,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its leaf does not wither;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he prospers in all that he does.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The wicked are not so.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, they are like chaff driven away by the wind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Therefore the wicked will not stand on the day of judgment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the path of the wicked will fail.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Why do the nations conspire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples plot in vain?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The kings of the earth take their stand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the rulers gather together<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;against the Lord and against His Messiah, saying,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;"Let us tear off their shackles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and throw off their cords from us."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The one sitting in heaven laughs;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord mocks them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Then He speaks to them in His anger<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and terrifies them in His wrath:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;"I have installed My king<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on Zion, My holy mountain."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;I will proclaim this decree, the Lord said to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You are My son; today I have begotten you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Ask of Me, and I will give the nations as your inheritance<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the ends of the earth as your possession.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;You will break them with a rod of iron;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you will shatter them like pottery."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Now therefore, O kings, be wise;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be warned, O rulers of the earth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Serve the Lord with fear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and rejoice with trembling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Kiss the son,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lest in His anger, you perish in the way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for his wrath is quickly kindled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed are all who take refuge in him.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Lord, how many are my foes!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many rise up against me;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;many say about me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There is no salvation for him in God.” Selah</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But You, O Lord, are a shield around me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my glory, and the One who lifts my head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;I cry aloud to the Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He answers me from His holy mountain. Selah</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I lay down and slept;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I awoke, for the Lord sustains me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I will not fear the multitudes of people<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who have set themselves against me all around.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Arise, O Lord! Save me, O my God!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For You strike all my enemies on the cheek;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You break the teeth of the wicked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Salvation belongs to the Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may Your blessing be upon Your people. Selah<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness! You have given me relief when I was in distress; be gracious to me and hear my prayer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;O sons of men, how long will you turn my glory into shame? How long will you love vanity and seek after lies?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But know that the Lord has set apart the godly man for Himself; the Lord hears when I call to Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Tremble, and do not sin; meditate in your heart upon your bed and be still.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Offer the sacrifices of righteousness and trust in the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Many say, “Who will show us any good?” Lift up the light of Your face upon us, O Lord!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;You have put joy in my heart, more than when their grain and new wine abound.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;In peace I will both lie down and sleep, for You alone, O Lord, make me dwell in safety.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Give ear to my words, O Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consider my groaning.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Listen to the sound of my cry,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my King and my God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for to You I pray.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;In the morning, O Lord, You hear my voice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the morning I lay my request before You and watch expectantly.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For You are not a God who delights in wickedness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evil does not dwell with You.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The boastful will not stand before Your eyes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hate all who do iniquity.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;You destroy those who speak lies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord abhors the man of bloodshed and deceit.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But as for me, by Your great mercy I will enter Your house;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in fear of You, I will bow down toward Your holy temple.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Lead me, O Lord, in Your righteousness because of my enemies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make Your way straight before me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For there is no truth in their mouth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their heart is destruction itself;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their throat is an open grave;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their tongue they speak deceit.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Make them bear their guilt, O God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them fall by their own schemes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast them out for their many transgressions,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for they have rebelled against You.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But let all who take refuge in You rejoice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them sing for joy forever.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread Your protection over them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that those who love Your name may exult in You.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For You bless the righteous, O Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You surround him with favor as with a shield.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;O Lord, do not rebuke me in Your anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor discipline me in Your wrath.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am weak;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heal me, O Lord, for my bones are troubled.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;My soul also is greatly troubled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but You, O Lord—how long?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Turn, O Lord, deliver my soul;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save me because of Your steadfast love.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For in death there is no remembrance of You;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the grave, who will give You praise?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I am weary with my groaning;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every night I flood my bed with tears;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I drench my couch with my weeping.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;My eye wastes away because of grief;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it grows weak because of all my foes.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The Lord has heard my plea;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord accepts my prayer.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;All my enemies shall be ashamed and greatly troubled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they shall turn back and be put to shame in a moment.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 7</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;O LORD my God, in You I take refuge;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;save me from all who pursue me, and deliver me,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;lest he tear my soul like a lion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rending it in pieces with no one to rescue.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;O LORD my God, if I have done this,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if there is injustice in my hands,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;if I have repaid evil to him who was at peace with me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or plundered my enemy without cause—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;let the enemy pursue my soul and overtake it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let him trample my life to the ground<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lay my glory in the dust. Selah</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD, in Your anger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lift Yourself up against the fury of my adversaries;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;awake for me—You have commanded judgment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Let the assembly of the peoples gather around You,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and over it return on high.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The LORD judges the peoples;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and according to my integrity within me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Let the evil of the wicked come to an end, but establish the righteous—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the righteous God tests the hearts and minds.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;My shield is with God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who saves the upright in heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;God is a righteous judge,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a God who has indignation every day.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;If a man does not repent, He sharpens His sword;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has bent His bow and made it ready.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;He has prepared His deadly weapons;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes His arrows fiery shafts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Behold, he is pregnant with wickedness:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he conceives trouble and gives birth to falsehood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;He dug a pit and hollowed it out,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and has fallen into the hole he made.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;His trouble returns upon his own head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his violence comes down upon his own skull.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;I will give thanks to the LORD according to His righteousness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and will sing praise to the name of the LORD Most High.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;O LORD, our Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how majestic is Your name in all the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You who have set Your splendor above the heavens!</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have established strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of Your adversaries,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to silence the enemy and the avenger.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;When I look at Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the moon and the stars, which You have set in place—</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;what is man that You take thought of him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the son of man that You care for him?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Yet You have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and crowned him with glory and honor.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;You have given him dominion over the works of Your hands;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have put all things under his feet:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;all sheep and oxen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and also the beasts of the field,</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whatever passes through the paths of the seas.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;O LORD, our Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how majestic is Your name in all the earth!<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 9</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I will give thanks to the LORD with my whole heart; I will recount all Your wondrous deeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I will be glad and rejoice in You; I will sing praise to Your name, O Most High.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;When my enemies turn back, they stumble and perish before You.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For You have upheld my right and my cause; You sat on the throne judging justly.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;You rebuked the nations; You destroyed the wicked; You blotted out their name forever and ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;The enemy came to an end in everlasting ruins; their cities You uprooted— even the memory of them has perished.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But the LORD sits enthroned forever; He has established His throne for judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He will judge the world with righteousness; He will execute judgment on the peoples with equity.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The LORD is a stronghold for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Those who know Your name trust in You, for You have not forsaken those who seek You, O LORD.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Sing praises to the LORD, who dwells in Zion! Proclaim His deeds among the nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For He who avenges blood remembers them; He does not forget the cry of the afflicted.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Be gracious to me, O LORD! See my affliction from those who hate me, You who lift me up from the gates of death,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;that I may recount all Your praises, in the gates of the daughter of Zion, that I may rejoice in Your salvation.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The nations have sunk into the pit they made; their foot is caught in the net they hid.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The LORD is known by the judgment He carries out; the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;The wicked will return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;For the needy shall not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor shall never perish.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD! Let not man prevail; let the nations be judged before You!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Put them in fear, O LORD; let the nations know they are but men. Selah.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 10</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Why, O LORD, do You stand far off? Why do You hide Yourself in times of trouble?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;In his pride the wicked hunts down the afflicted; let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For the wicked boasts of the desires of his soul; the greedy man curses and despises the LORD.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;In the arrogance of his face the wicked does not seek Him; all his thoughts are, “There is no God.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;His ways always prosper; Your judgments are far above, out of his sight; as for all his foes, he snorts at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He says in his heart, “I shall not be moved; through all generations I shall not meet adversity.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression; under his tongue are mischief and iniquity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;He sits in ambush near the villages; in hidden places he murders the innocent. His eyes watch closely for the helpless.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He lies in wait in secret like a lion in his thicket; he lies in ambush to seize the afflicted; he seizes the afflicted when he draws them into his net.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;He crouches, he bows down, and the helpless fall by his might.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He says in his heart, “God has forgotten, He hides His face, He will never see.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD! O God, lift up Your hand; do not forget the afflicted.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Why does the wicked despise God and say in his heart, “You will not call to account”?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;But You do see, for You behold trouble and vexation to take it into Your hand. To You the helpless commits himself; You are the helper of the fatherless.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Break the arm of the wicked and the evildoer; call his wickedness to account until You find none.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The LORD is King forever and ever; the nations perish from His land.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;O LORD, You hear the desire of the humble; You will strengthen their heart; You will incline Your ear&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;to give justice to the fatherless and the oppressed, so that man who is of the earth may terrify no more.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 11</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;In the Lord I have taken refuge; how can you say to my soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Flee to your mountain like a bird”?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For behold, the wicked bend the bow;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have set their arrow on the string<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to shoot in the dark at the upright in heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;If the foundations are torn down,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what can the righteous do?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The Lord is in His holy temple;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Lord—His throne is in heaven.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyes behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His eyelids test the sons of man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The Lord tests the righteous,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in His inmost being he hates the wicked and the one who loves violence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He will rain down snares on the wicked:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fire and brimstone and a scorching wind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be the portion of their cup.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For the Lord is righteous; He loves righteous deeds;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the upright shall behold His face.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 12</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Save, O LORD, for the godly man has come to an end;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the faithful have vanished from among the sons of man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Everyone speaks falsehood with his neighbor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with flattering lips and a double heart they speak.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;May the LORD cut off all flattering lips,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tongue that boasts great things—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;those who have said, “By our tongue we will prevail;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our lips are with us—who is master over us?”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;“Because of the oppression of the poor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the groaning of the needy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;now I will arise,” says the LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I will set him in safety, the one who longs for it.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;The words of the LORD are pure words,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like silver refined in a crucible on the ground,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purified seven times.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;You, O LORD, will keep them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will guard him from this generation forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The wicked strut about on every side,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when vileness is exalted among the sons of man.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 13</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long will You hide Your face from me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;How long must I take counsel in my soul,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have sorrow in my heart all day long?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long shall my enemy be exalted over me?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Look upon me and answer, O LORD my God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give light to my eyes, lest I sleep in death,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;lest my enemy say, “I have prevailed over him,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my foes rejoice because I am shaken.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;But I have trusted in Your steadfast love;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart shall rejoice in Your salvation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I will sing to the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for He has dealt bountifully with me.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 14</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are corrupt; they do vile deeds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one who does good.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The Lord looks down from heaven upon the sons of man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see if there is anyone who understands, anyone who seeks after God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;All have turned aside; together they have become corrupt.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no one who does good—no, not even one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Do all the workers of iniquity not know, who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the Lord?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;There they are in great dread, for God is with the righteous generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;You would put to shame the counsel of the poor, but the Lord is his refuge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Lord restores the fortunes of His people, Jacob shall rejoice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel shall be glad.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 15</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;O Lord, who may dwell in your tent?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who may live on your holy mountain?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He who walks blamelessly and does what is right,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who speaks the truth from his heart,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;who does not slander with his tongue,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does no harm to his neighbor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not cast reproach on his friend;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;in whose eyes a vile man is despised,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but who honors those who fear the Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who swears to his own hurt and does not change;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;who does not lend his money at interest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not accept a bribe against the innocent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He who does these things shall never be shaken.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 16</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Preserve me, O God, for I take refuge in You.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I said to the LORD, “You are my Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no good apart from You.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;As for the holy ones who are in the land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are the noble ones in whom is all my delight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The sorrows of those who chase after another god will multiply;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will I take their names upon my lips.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You hold my lot.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;The lines have fallen for me in pleasant places;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;I will bless the LORD who gives me counsel;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the night also my conscience instructs me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I have set the LORD always before me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because He is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my flesh also dwells secure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For You will not abandon my soul to the grave,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor will You let Your holy one see decay.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;You make known to me the path of life;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in Your presence is fullness of joy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 17</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Hear, O LORD, my just cause; attend to my cry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Let my vindication come from your presence;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let your eyes behold what is right.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;You have tested my heart, you have visited me by night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have tried me and found nothing;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have purposed that my mouth will not transgress.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;As for the deeds of men, by the word of your lips<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have avoided the paths of the violent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;My steps have held fast to your paths;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my feet have not slipped.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I call upon you, for you will answer me, O God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incline your ear to me; hear my words.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Show the wonder of your steadfast love, O Savior<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to those who seek refuge from their adversaries at your right hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Keep me as the apple of the eye;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hide me in the shadow of your wings,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;from the wicked who do me violence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my deadly enemies who surround me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;They close their hearts to pity;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with their mouths they speak arrogantly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;They have now surrounded our steps;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they set their eyes to cast us down to the ground.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;He is like a lion eager to tear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a young lion lurking in hiding places.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Arise, O LORD, confront him, bring him low;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliver my soul from the wicked by your sword,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;from men, by your hand, O LORD, from men of the world whose portion is in this life.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You fill their belly with your treasure;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they are satisfied with children and leave their abundance to their infants.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;As for me, I shall behold your face in righteousness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when I awake, I shall be satisfied with your likeness.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 18</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I love you, O LORD, my strength.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my God, my rock in whom I take refuge, my shield,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I call upon the LORD, who is worthy of praise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I am saved from my enemies.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;The cords of death encompassed me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The cords of the grave entangled me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the snares of death confronted me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;In my distress I called upon the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to my God I cried for help.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From His temple He heard my voice,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my cry before Him came into His ears.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Then the earth shook and quaked;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the foundations of the mountains trembled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and were shaken, because He was angry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Smoke went up from His nostrils, and devouring fire from His mouth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;glowing coals blazed forth from Him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He bowed the heavens and came down;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thick darkness was under His feet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;He rode on a cherub and flew;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He came swiftly on the wings of the wind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;He made darkness His covering, His canopy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;around Him, thick clouds, dark with water.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;From the brightness before Him, hailstones and coals of fire passed through His clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The LORD thundered from the heavens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Most High uttered His voice, hailstones and coals of fire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;He sent out His arrows and scattered them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He flashed forth lightning and routed them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Then the channels of the sea were exposed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the foundations of the world were laid bare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at Your rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of Your nostrils.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;He reached down from on high and took hold of me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drew me out of many waters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;He rescued me from my powerful enemy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from those who hated me, for they were too strong for me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;They confronted me in the day of my calamity,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD was my support.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;He brought me out into a spacious place;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rescued me because He delighted in me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the cleanness of my hands He repaid me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;For I have kept the ways of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have not wickedly departed from my God.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For all His judgments were before me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I did not put away His statutes from me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;I was blameless before Him, and I kept myself from guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;So the LORD has repaid me according to my righteousness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the cleanness of my hands in His sight.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;With the merciful You show Yourself merciful;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the blameless man You show Yourself blameless;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;with the pure You show Yourself pure,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and with the crooked You make Yourself seem shrewd.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;For You save a humble people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the haughty eyes You bring down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;For it is You who light my lamp;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD my God illumines my darkness.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;For by You I can run against a troop,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by my God I can leap over a wall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;This God—His way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a shield for all who take refuge in Him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;For who is God but the LORD?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who is a rock except our God?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;The God who girds me with strength and makes my way blameless,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;He makes my feet like the feet of a deer and sets me secure on the heights.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;He trains my hands for war, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;You have given me the shield of Your salvation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Your right hand upheld me, and Your gentleness made me great.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;You gave a wide place beneath my steps, and my feet did not slip.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;I pursued my enemies and overtook them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not turn back until they were consumed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;I struck them down so that they were not able to rise;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they fell under my feet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;For You girded me with strength for the battle;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You made those who rose against me sink under me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;You made my enemies turn their backs to me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who hated me I destroyed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;They cried for help, but there was none to save;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they cried to the LORD, but He did not answer them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;I beat them fine as dust before the wind;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cast them out like the mire of the streets.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;You delivered me from the strife of the people;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You made me the head of the nations;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a people I had not known served me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;foreigners came cringing to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;Foreigners lost heart and came trembling from their strongholds.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and exalted be the God of my salvation—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;the God who gave me vengeance and subdued nations under me,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;who delivered me from my enemies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed, You exalted me above those who rose against me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You rescued me from the man of violence.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;Therefore I will give thanks to You, O LORD, among the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sing praises to Your name.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;He gives great salvation to His king, and shows steadfast love to His anointed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to David and his offspring forever.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 19</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The heavens declare the glory of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the sky above proclaims the work of his hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Day to day pours forth speech,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and night to night reveals knowledge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;There is no speech, nor are there words;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their voice is not heard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Yet their line goes out through all the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their words to the end of the world.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In them he has set a tent for the sun,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;which comes out like a bridegroom leaving his chamber,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and, like a strong man, runs its course with joy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Its rising is from the end of the heavens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and its circuit to the end of them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is nothing hidden from its heat.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;The law of the LORD is perfect, restoring the soul;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the testimony of the LORD is trustworthy, making the simple wise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The precepts of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the judgments of the LORD are true and altogether righteous.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sweeter also than honey and drippings from the honeycomb.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Moreover, by them your servant is warned;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in keeping them there is great reward.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Who can discern his errors?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleanse me from hidden faults.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them not have dominion over me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I shall be blameless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and innocent of great transgression.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be acceptable in your sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O LORD, my rock and my redeemer.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 20</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may the name of the God of Jacob protect you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;May He send you help from the sanctuary and support you from Zion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;May He remember all your offerings and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices. Selah.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;May He grant you your heart’s desire and fulfill all your plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;We will shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the LORD fulfill all your petitions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Now I know that the LORD saves His anointed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will answer him from His holy heaven with the saving might of His right hand.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;O LORD, save the king! May He answer us when we call.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 21</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;O LORD, the king rejoices in Your strength, and how greatly he exults in Your salvation!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;You have granted him the desire of his heart and have not withheld the request of his lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For You come to meet him with blessings of good things; You set a crown of pure gold upon his head.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He asked You for life, and You gave it to him—length of days, forever and ever.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;His glory is great through Your salvation; You bestow majesty and splendor upon him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For You make him most blessed forever; You make him glad with the joy of Your presence.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be shaken.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Your hand will find out all Your enemies; Your right hand will seize those who hate You.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;You will make them like a fiery furnace at the time of Your appearing. The LORD will swallow them up in His wrath, and fire will consume them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;You will destroy their offspring from the earth, and their descendants from among the sons of man.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Though they plan evil against You, though they devise schemes, they will not succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For You will put them to flight; You will aim Your bow at their faces.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Be exalted, O LORD, in Your strength! We will sing and praise Your power.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 22</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are You so far from saving me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the words of my groaning?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;My God, I call out by day, but You do not answer;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by night—but I find no rest.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Yet You are holy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enthroned upon the praises of Israel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;In You our fathers trusted;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they trusted, and You delivered them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;To You they cried and were rescued;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in You they trusted and were not put to shame.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;But I am a worm and not a man,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scorned by men and despised by the people.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;All who see me mock me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they open wide their mouths; they wag their heads:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;“He trusts in the LORD; let Him deliver him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let Him rescue him, for He delights in him.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Yet You are the one who brought me out of the womb;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You made me trust You from my mother's breasts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;On You I was cast from birth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from my mother’s womb You have been my God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Do not be far from me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for trouble is near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there is no one to help.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Many bulls surround me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strong bulls of Bashan encircle me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;They open wide their mouths at me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a ravenous and roaring lion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I am poured out like water,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all my bones are disjointed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart is like wax—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it melts within me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;My strength is dried up like a potsherd,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my tongue clings to my jaws;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You lay me in the dust of death.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For dogs have surrounded me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a gang of evildoers has encircled me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they have pierced my hands and feet.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;I can count all my bones—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they look, they stare at me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;They divide my garments among themselves,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and for my clothing they cast lots.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;But You, O LORD, do not be far off!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O my strength, come quickly to help me!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Deliver my soul from the sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my precious life from the power of the dog.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Save me from the lion’s mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and from the horns of wild oxen—You have answered me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;I will declare Your name to my brothers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the midst of the congregation I will praise You.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;You who fear the LORD, praise Him!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All you descendants of Jacob, glorify Him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and stand in awe of Him, all you descendants of Israel!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;For He has not despised nor abhorred<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the affliction of the afflicted,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He has not hidden His face from him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when he cried to Him, He heard.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;From You comes my praise in the great congregation;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my vows I will fulfill before those who fear Him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;The afflicted shall eat and be satisfied;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those who seek Him shall praise the LORD.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May your heart live forever!</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the families of the nations shall bow down before You.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;For the kingdom is the LORD’s,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He rules over the nations.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;All the prosperous of the earth shall eat and bow down;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all who go down to the dust shall bow before Him—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even he who could not keep his soul alive.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Posterity shall serve Him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it shall be told of the Lord to the coming generation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;They shall come and proclaim His righteousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to a people yet to be born,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that He has done it.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 23</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The Lord is my shepherd; I shall lack nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He makes me lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside still waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He restores my soul; He guides me in paths of righteousness for His name’s sake.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Even though I walk through the valley of deep darkness, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall pursue me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 24</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The earth is the Lord’s, and all that fills it, the world and those who dwell in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For He founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Who may ascend the mountain of the Lord? And who may stand in His holy place?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not lifted up his soul to falsehood and has not sworn deceitfully.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;He shall receive blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the God of his salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;This is the generation of those who seek Him, who seek Your face—O God of Jacob.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Lift up your heads, O gates, and be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Who is this King of Glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Lift up your heads, O gates, and lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of Glory may enter!&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Who is this King of Glory? The Lord of hosts—He is the King of Glory.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 25</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;To You, O LORD, I lift up my soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;My God, in You I trust; do not let me be put to shame; do not let my enemies exult over me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Indeed, none who wait for You will be put to shame; they shall be put to shame who act treacherously without cause.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Make me know Your ways, O LORD; teach me Your paths.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Lead me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; for You I wait all the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Remember Your mercies, O LORD, and Your steadfast love, for they are from of old.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Do not remember the sins of my youth or my transgressions; according to Your steadfast love remember me, for the sake of Your goodness, O LORD.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Good and upright is the LORD; therefore He instructs sinners in the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He leads the humble in justice and teaches the humble His way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;All the paths of the LORD are steadfast love and faithfulness to those who keep His covenant and His testimonies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;For the sake of Your name, O LORD, pardon my guilt, for it is great.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Who is the man who fears the LORD? This man will be instructed in the way he should choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;His soul shall abide in prosperity, and his descendants shall inherit the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The secret of the LORD is with those who fear Him, and He makes them know His covenant.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;My eyes are ever toward the LORD, for He will free my feet from the net.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Turn to me and be gracious to me, for I am lonely and afflicted.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;The troubles of my heart are enlarged; bring me out of my distresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Look upon my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Consider my enemies, for they are many, as are those who hate me with violent hatred.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Guard my soul and deliver me; let me not be put to shame, for I take refuge in You.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Let integrity and uprightness preserve me, for I wait for You.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I wash my hands in innocence and go around Your altar, O LORD,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;to proclaim thanksgiving aloud and to recount all Your wondrous deeds.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;O LORD, I love the habitation of Your house and the place where Your glory dwells.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Do not sweep away my soul with sinners, nor my life with men of blood,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;in whose hands are evil plots and whose right hand is full of bribes.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;One thing I have asked from the LORD, that I will seek:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to behold the beauty of the LORD and to inquire in His temple.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For He will hide me in His shelter in the day of trouble;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will conceal me in the hiding place of His tent;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will lift me high upon a rock.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies all around me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I will offer in His tent sacrifices with shouts of joy;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sing and make melody to the LORD.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Hear, O LORD, my voice when I cry out;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be gracious to me and answer me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;On Your behalf my heart has said, “Seek My face.”<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have been my help; do not forsake me or abandon me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O God of my salvation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Though my father and my mother have forsaken me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD will take me in.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Teach me Your way, O LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lead me on a level path because of my foes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Do not give me up to the will of my adversaries,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for false witnesses have risen against me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they breathe out violence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;I believe that I shall see the goodness of the LORD<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of the living.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Wait for the LORD; be strong,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and You have healed me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;O LORD, You have brought me up alive from the grave;<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Sing praise to the LORD, O you His faithful ones,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for You are my refuge.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Into Your hand I commit my spirit;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have redeemed me, O LORD, God of truth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I hate those who regard worthless idols,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have set my feet in a broad place.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my eye is wasted from grief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my soul and my body also.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For my life is spent with sorrow<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the LORD delivers him out of them all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;He keeps all his bones;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not one of them is broken.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Evil will slay the wicked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and those who hate the righteous will be condemned.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;The LORD redeems the soul of His servants;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;none of those who take refuge in Him will be condemned.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 35</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Contend, O Lord, with those who contend against me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fight against those who fight me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Take up shield and armor; rise up and come to my aid.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Draw out the spear and javelin against my pursuers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say to my soul, “I am your salvation.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Let those who seek my life be put to shame and dishonored;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let those who plot evil against me be turned back and humiliated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Let their path be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For without cause they hid their net for me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without reason they dug a pit for my soul.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Let destruction come upon them unexpectedly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let the net they hid ensnare them; let them fall into their own pit to their ruin.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Then my soul will rejoice in the Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it will delight in His salvation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;All my bones will say, “O Lord, who is like You,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who rescues the poor from those too strong for them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the poor and needy from those who rob them?”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Malicious witnesses rise up;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they accuse me of things I know nothing about.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;They repay me evil for good, leaving my soul bereft.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Yet when they were sick, I put on sackcloth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I humbled myself with fasting, and my prayer returned to my own heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I went about as though grieving for a friend or brother;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bowed down in mourning, as one lamenting a mother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they gathered against me, attackers I did not know, tearing at me without ceasing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Like godless mockers at a feast, they gnashed their teeth at me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;O Lord, how long will You look on?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rescue my soul from their ravages, my precious life from the lions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;I will give You thanks in the great assembly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;among a mighty throng I will praise You.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not let those who hate me without cause wink their eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;For they do not speak peace, but devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;They open their mouths wide against me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they say, “Aha, aha! Our eyes have seen it!”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;You have seen this, O Lord; do not remain silent.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O Lord, do not be far from me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Awake and rise to my defense, to my cause, my God and my Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Vindicate me, O Lord my God, according to Your righteousness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and do not let them rejoice over me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Do not let them say in their hearts, “Aha, just what we wanted!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not let them say, “We have swallowed him up.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Let all who rejoice at my calamity be ashamed and confounded together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let those who exalt themselves over me be clothed with shame and dishonor.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Let those who delight in my righteousness shout for joy and be glad;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let them say continually, “The Lord be exalted, who delights in the prosperity of His servant.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;And my tongue will proclaim Your righteousness and Your praise all day long.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 36</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;A declaration of rebellion resides in the heart of the wicked; there is no dread of God before their eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For they flatter themselves in their own sight, thinking their guilt will not be uncovered or despised.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The words of their mouth are wicked and deceitful; they have stopped acting wisely or doing good.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;They plot wickedness on their beds; they commit themselves to a crooked path; they do not reject evil.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Your steadfast love, O Lord, reaches to the heavens, your faithfulness extends to the clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Your righteousness is like the mighty mountains, your judgments are like the vast deep; you preserve both man and beast, O Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;How precious is your steadfast love, O God! The sons of man take refuge in the shadow of your wings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;They feast on the abundance of your house, and you give them drink from the river of your delights.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For with you is the fountain of life; in your light we see light.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Continue your steadfast love to those who know you, and your righteousness to the upright in heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Do not let the foot of the arrogant trample me, nor the hand of the wicked drive me away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;There the evildoers have fallen; they are thrust down and cannot rise.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 37</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Do not be provoked by evildoers; do not be envious of those who do wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For like grass they will soon wither, and like green plants they will fade away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Trust in the Lord and do good; dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Commit your way to the Lord; trust in Him, and He will act.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;He will bring forth your righteousness like the light, and your justice like the noonday sun.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him; do not be provoked by the man who prospers in his way, by the man who carries out wicked schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Cease from anger and forsake wrath; do not be provoked—it leads only to evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;For evildoers will be cut off, but those who wait for the Lord will inherit the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Yet a little while, and the wicked man will be no more; though you look for his place, he will not be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But the humble will inherit the land and will delight in abundant peace.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;The wicked man plots against the righteous and gnashes his teeth at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;The Lord laughs at him, for He sees that his day is coming.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow to bring down the poor and needy, to slay those whose way is upright.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Their sword will enter their own heart, and their bows will be broken.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Better is the little that the righteous man has than the abundance of many wicked men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but the Lord upholds the righteous.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;The Lord knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will last forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;They will not be ashamed        In evil times, and in days of famine they will be satisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;But the wicked will perish; the enemies of the Lord, like the glory of the pastures, will vanish—they will vanish like smoke.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;The wicked man borrows and does not repay, but the righteous man is gracious and gives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;For those blessed by Him will inherit the land, but those cursed by Him will be cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;The steps of a man are established by the Lord, and He delights in his way.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Though he falls, he will not be cast down, for the Lord upholds his hand.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;I have been young, and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;All day long he is gracious and lends, and his offspring are a blessing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;Turn away from evil and do good, and dwell forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;For the Lord loves justice and will not forsake His godly ones; they are preserved forever, but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;The mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom, and his tongue speaks justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;The law of his God is in his heart; his steps do not slip.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;The wicked man watches the righteous and seeks to kill him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;The Lord will not abandon him to his hand or let him be condemned when he is judged.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;Wait for the Lord and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land; when the wicked are cut off, you will see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;I have seen a wicked, ruthless man flourishing like a luxuriant native tree.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;But he passed away, and behold, he was no more; though I sought him, he could not be found.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;Observe the blameless man and consider the upright, for the man of peace has a future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;But transgressors will be destroyed together; the future of the wicked will be cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;The salvation of the righteous is from the Lord; He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;The Lord helps them and delivers them; He delivers them from the wicked and saves them, because they take refuge in Him.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 38</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;O Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor discipline me in your wrath.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;For your arrows have pierced me, and your hand has come down upon me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;There is no soundness in my flesh because of your indignation; there is no health in my bones because of my sin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For my iniquities have gone over my head; like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;My wounds stink and fester because of my foolishness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I am bent over and greatly bowed down; I go about mourning all day long.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;For my loins are filled with burning, and there is no soundness in my flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan because of the turmoil of my heart.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Lord, all my longing is before you, and my sighing is not hidden from you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;My heart throbs, my strength fails me, and the light of my eyes—it also has gone from me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my kinsmen stand far off.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Those who seek my life lay snares for me; those who seek my hurt speak of ruin and meditate treachery all day long.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But I am like a deaf man; I do not hear, like a mute man who does not open his mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;I have become like a man who does not hear, and in whose mouth are no rebukes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;For I hope in you, O Lord; you will answer, O Lord my God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For I said, “Lest they rejoice over me; when my foot slips, they magnify themselves against me.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For I am ready to fall, and my pain is always before me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;But my enemies are vigorous; they are strong, and those who hate me wrongfully are multiplied.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Those who render me evil for good accuse me because I follow after good.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Do not forsake me, O Lord; O my God, be not far from me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Hasten to help me, O Lord, my salvation.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 39</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I said, "I will guard my ways,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may not sin with my tongue;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will put a muzzle on my mouth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the wicked are in my presence."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I was silent and held my peace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even from good,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but my distress grew worse.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;My heart grew hot within me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as I meditated, the fire burned.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I spoke with my tongue:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;"O Lord, make me know my end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the measure of my days, what it is;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let me know how fleeting I am.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Behold, You have made my days a few handbreadths,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my lifetime is as nothing before You.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely every man stands as a mere breath.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Surely man goes about as a shadow!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely they busy themselves in vain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he heaps up wealth, not knowing who will gather it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My hope is in You.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Deliver me from all my transgressions;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not make me the scorn of the fool.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;I am silent; I do not open my mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for You have done it.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Remove Your stroke from me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am worn down by the blow of Your hand.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;When You discipline a man with rebukes for sin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You consume like a moth what is dear to him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surely every man is but a breath.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Hear my prayer, O Lord,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and give ear to my cry;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not be silent at my tears.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am a sojourner with You,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a foreigner, as all my fathers were.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Look away from me, that I may regain strength<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before I depart and am no more.”<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 40</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I waited patiently for the Lord, and He turned to me and heard my cry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;He lifted me out of the pit of destruction, out of the muddy clay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and set my feet on a rock, making my steps secure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;He put a new song in my mouth, a hymn of praise to our God.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Blessed is the man who makes the Lord his trust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who does not turn to the proud or to those who follow lies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Lord my God, You have done many wondrous things—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your plans for us are beyond compare.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were to speak and declare them all, they would be too numerous to count.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;You take no delight in sacrifice and offering; You have opened my ears.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burnt offerings and sin offerings You have not required.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Then I said, “Here I am; in the scroll of the book it is written about me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I delight to do Your will, my God; Your law is within my heart.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;I have proclaimed righteousness in the great assembly;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indeed, I do not restrain my lips—You, Lord, know this.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;I have not hidden Your righteousness in my heart;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather, I have spoken openly of Your faithfulness and salvation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have not concealed Your lovingkindness and truth from the great assembly.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Lord, do not withhold Your mercy from me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may Your lovingkindness and truth always guard me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For troubles without number have surrounded me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my iniquities have overtaken me—I cannot see.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are more than the hairs of my head, and my courage has abandoned me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Lord, be pleased to rescue me; hurry to help me, O Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Let those who seek to destroy my life be ashamed and humiliated together;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let those who take delight in my harm be turned back in disgrace.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Let those who say to me, “Aha! Aha!” be appalled because of their shame.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;But may all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may those who love Your salvation always say, “The Lord is great!”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord thinks of me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are my help and my deliverer—my God, do not delay.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 41</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Blessed is the man who considers the poor;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the LORD will deliver him in the day of trouble.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;The LORD will protect him and keep him alive;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he will be called blessed in the land.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not hand him over to the desire of his enemies.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;The LORD will sustain him on his sickbed;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in his illness, You restore him to full health.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;As for me, I said, “O LORD, be gracious to me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;My enemies speak evil of me: “When will he die and his name perish?”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And if one comes to see me, he speaks lies;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his heart gathers iniquity for itself. When he goes out, he tells it abroad.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;All who hate me whisper together against me;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they imagine the worst for me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;They say, “A wicked thing is poured out upon him;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who ate my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;But You, O LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up, that I may repay them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;By this I know that You delight in me:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my enemy does not triumph over me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;As for me, You uphold me in my integrity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and set me in Your presence forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and Amen.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 42</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all Your breakers and Your waves have gone over me.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;By day the Lord commands His lovingkindness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and at night His song is with me— a prayer to the God of my life.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;I say to God, my rock, “Why have You forgotten me?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why must I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;As with a deadly wound in my bones, my adversaries taunt me,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Yet you have rejected us and disgraced us, and you do not go out with our armies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;You make us turn back from the foe, and those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;You make us like sheep for slaughter and have scattered us among the nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;You sell your people for nothing and have gained no profit from their sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;You make us a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and derision to those around us.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;All day long my disgrace is before me, and the shame of my face covers me&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;because of the voice of the one who taunts and reviles, because of the enemy and the avenger.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;All this has come upon us, yet we have not forgotten you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor have we been false to your covenant.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Our heart has not turned back,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor have our steps departed from your way,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;though you have crushed us in the place of jackals<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and covered us with deep darkness.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;If we had forgotten the name of our God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or spread out our hands to a foreign god,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;would not God discover this?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For he knows the secrets of the heart.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Yet for your sake we are killed all day long;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Awake! Why do you sleep, O Lord?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arise! Do not reject us forever.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Why do you hide your face?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you forget our affliction and oppression?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;For our soul is bowed down to the dust;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our belly clings to the ground.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Rise up; come to our help.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Redeem us for the sake of your steadfast love.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 48</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in His holy mountain.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth, Mount Zion on the far north, the city of the great King.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;God is in her citadels; He is known as her refuge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For behold, the kings assembled, they passed by together.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;They saw it, then they were astounded; they were dismayed and fled in panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Trembling seized them there, anguish like that of a woman in labor.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;With the east wind You shattered the ships of Tarshish.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Just as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish her forever. Selah.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 49</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Hear this, all nations;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;give ear, all inhabitants of the world,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;both low and high, rich and poor together.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;My mouth shall speak wisdom, and the meditation of my heart shall be understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;I will incline my ear to a proverb;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will solve my riddle to the music of the lyre.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Why should I fear in days of evil, when the iniquity of my foes surrounds me,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;those who trust in their wealth and boast in the abundance of their riches?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;A brother can by no means redeem;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a man cannot give to God a ransom for him—<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;for the redemption of their soul is costly, and he must abandon the attempt forever—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;so that he should live on forever and not see the pit.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For he sees that wise men die; likewise the fool and the senseless perish, and leave their wealth to others.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Their graves are their houses forever, their dwelling places from generation to generation, though they had named lands after themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;But man, though in honor, does not endure; he is like the beasts that perish.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;This is the path of those who are foolish, and of those after them who approve of their sayings. Selah.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Like sheep they are appointed for the grave; death shall be their shepherd, and the upright shall rule over them in the morning. Their form shall waste away in the grave, far from their lofty abode.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;But God will redeem my soul from the hand of the grave, for He will receive me. Selah.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;Do not be afraid when a man becomes rich, when the glory of his house increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For when he dies he will carry nothing away; his glory will not descend after him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Though he blesses himself during his life— and though men praise you when you prosper—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;he shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see the light.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;A man who is honored yet does not understand is like the beasts that perish.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 50</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;The Mighty One, God, the LORD, has spoken and summoned the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shone forth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Our God comes and does not keep silence; a fire devours before Him, and around Him a mighty tempest rages.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that He may judge His people:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;"Gather to Me My faithful ones, those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice."&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;And the heavens declare His righteousness, for God Himself is judge. Selah.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;"Hear, O My people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against you: I am God, your God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before Me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;I will not take a bull from your house, nor goats from your folds.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For every beast of the forest is Mine, the cattle on a thousand hills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;I know all the birds of the mountains, and everything that moves in the field is Mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;If I were hungry, I would not tell you, for the world and its fullness are Mine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Do I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving, and fulfill your vows to the Most High.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;And call upon Me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify Me."</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;But to the wicked God says: "What right have you to recite My statutes or to take My covenant on your lips?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For you hate discipline, and you cast My words behind you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;When you see a thief, you are pleased with him, and you keep company with adulterers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;You give your mouth free rein for evil, and your tongue frames deceit.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;You sit and speak against your brother; you slander your own mother's son.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;These things you have done, and I kept silent; you thought that I was one like yourself. But now I rebuke you and lay the charge before your eyes.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Mark this, then, you who forget God, lest I tear you apart, and there be none to deliver.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;He who offers a sacrifice of thanksgiving honors Me; and to him who orders his way rightly I will show the salvation of God."</p>

    <h2>Chapter 51</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your steadfast love; according to the greatness of Your compassion, blot out my transgressions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Against You, and You alone, I have sinned, and have done what is evil in Your sight, so that You are justified when You speak, and blameless when You judge.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Behold, You desire truth in the inward parts, and in the hidden place You make me know wisdom.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Let me hear joy and gladness; let my bones, which You have crushed, rejoice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Hide Your face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Do not cast me away from Your presence, and do not take Your Holy Spirit from me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, and sustain me with a willing spirit.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, and sinners shall return to You.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Deliver me from bloodguilt, O God, God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of Your righteousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For You do not desire sacrifice, or I would give it; You do not take pleasure in burnt offerings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, You will not despise.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Do good to Zion in Your good pleasure; build the walls of Jerusalem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Then You will delight in righteous sacrifices, in burnt offering and whole burnt offering; then bulls will be offered on Your altar.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 52</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steadfast love of God endures all day long.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Your tongue devises destruction,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a sharpened razor, working deceit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;You love evil more than good,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that shame has covered my face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;I have become a stranger to my brothers,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;When I wept and humbled my soul with fasting,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;For they have no pains until death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their bodies are fat and sleek.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;They are not in trouble as other men are;<br>

    <h2>Chapter 75</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;When I choose the appointed time,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I judge with equity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;When the earth and all its inhabitants tremble,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is I who steady its pillars. Selah</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;I say to the boastful, “Do not boast,”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to the wicked, “Do not lift up the horn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Do not lift up your horn on high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not speak with an arrogant neck.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;For lifting people up does not come from the east or from the west,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither from the wilderness,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;but God is the judge:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he brings one down and lifts up another.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with foaming wine, fully mixed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he pours out from it,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the wicked of the earth shall drain it down to the dregs.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;But I will declare it forever;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;And all the horns of the wicked I will cut off,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 76</h2>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war. Selah</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Glorious are you, majestic from the mountains of prey.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The stouthearted were plundered; they slept their sleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and none of the warriors could lift their hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;At your rebuke, O God of Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both rider and horse lay stunned.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who can stand before you once your anger is aroused?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;From heaven you pronounced judgment;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth feared and was still,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;when God arose to execute judgment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to save all the humble of the earth. Selah</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For the wrath of man shall praise you;<br>

    <h2>Chapter 77</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I cry aloud to God—aloud to God, that he may hear me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my hand was stretched out in the night and did not grow weary;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my soul refused to be comforted.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;I remember God, and I moan;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meditate, and my spirit grows faint. Selah<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;You hold open my eyelids;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so troubled that I cannot speak.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;I consider the days of old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the years of long ago.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I call to mind my song in the night;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I meditate with my heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and my spirit searches diligently:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;“Will the Lord spurn forever,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and never again show favor?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Has his loyal love ceased forever?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has his promise come to an end for all time?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;Has God forgotten to be gracious?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has he shut up his compassion in anger?” Selah</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Then I said, “It is my grief,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;I will remember the deeds of the LORD;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;yes, I will remember your wonders of old.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;I will meditate on all your work<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ponder your mighty deeds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Your way, O God, is holy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What god is great like God?</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;You are the God who works wonders;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have made known your might among the nations.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;With your arm you redeemed your people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;The waters saw you, O God;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the waters saw you—and they writhed;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the skies gave forth a sound;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your arrows flashed to and fro.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the earth trembled and shook.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Your way was through the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and your path through the great waters,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;You led your people like a flock<br>

    <h2>Chapter 78</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Give ear, O my people, to my instruction;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;incline your ears to the words of my mouth.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;I will open my mouth with a parable;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will utter hidden sayings of old,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;which we have heard and known,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and our fathers have told us.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;We will not hide them from their children,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;telling to the next generation the praises of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his strength and his wondrous deeds that he has done.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For he established a testimony in Jacob<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and set a law in Israel,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which he commanded our fathers to teach their children,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;so that the next generation might know them—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the children yet to be born—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they might arise and tell them to their children,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;that they might put their trust in God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and not forget the works of God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but keep his commandments;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;and not be like their fathers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a stubborn and rebellious generation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a generation that did not set its heart aright,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;The sons of Ephraim, armed with the bow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned back on the day of battle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;They did not keep the covenant of God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and refused to walk in his law.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;They forgot his deeds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his wonders that he had shown them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the land of Egypt, in the fields of Zoan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;He divided the sea and caused them to pass through,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he made the waters stand like a heap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;He led them with a cloud by day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the night with a light of fire.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;He split rocks in the wilderness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave them abundant drink as from the deep.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;He brought streams out of the rock<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and caused waters to flow down like rivers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Yet they continued to sin against him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to rebel against the Most High in the desert.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;They tested God in their heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by demanding food to satisfy their cravings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;They spoke against God, saying,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;See how he struck the rock so that water gushed out<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and streams overflowed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can he also give bread<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or provide meat for his people?”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Therefore the LORD heard and was full of wrath;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a fire was kindled against Jacob,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and anger also rose against Israel,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;because they did not believe in God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not trust in his salvation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Yet he commanded the skies above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and opened the doors of heaven.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;He rained down manna upon them to eat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave them the grain of heaven.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Man ate the bread of angels;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he sent them food in abundance.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and by his power he led out the south wind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;He rained meat upon them like dust,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and winged birds like the sand of the seas.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;He made them fall in the midst of their camp,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all around their dwellings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;So they ate and were well filled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he gave them what they craved.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;But before they had satisfied their craving,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the food was still in their mouths,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;the anger of God rose against them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he killed the strongest of them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and laid low the young men of Israel.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;In spite of all this they still sinned<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not believe in his wondrous works.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;So he made their days vanish like a breath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their years in sudden terror.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;When he killed them, they sought him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they returned and earnestly sought God.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;They remembered that God was their rock,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Most High God their redeemer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;But they flattered him with their mouth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and lied to him with their tongue.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;For their heart was not steadfast toward him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nor were they faithful to his covenant.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;But he, being compassionate, forgave their iniquity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not destroy them.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Often he turned his anger away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not stir up all his wrath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;He remembered that they were but flesh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a wind that passes and does not return.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and grieved him in the desert!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;Again and again they tested God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and provoked the Holy One of Israel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;They did not remember his power<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or the day when he redeemed them from the foe,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;when he performed his signs in Egypt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his wonders in the fields of Zoan.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;He turned their rivers to blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that they could not drink from their streams.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and frogs, which destroyed them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>46</sup>&nbsp;He gave their crops to the caterpillar<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the fruit of their labor to the locust.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>47</sup>&nbsp;He destroyed their vines with hail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their sycamores with frost.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>48</sup>&nbsp;He gave over their livestock to the hail<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their flocks to fiery bolts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>49</sup>&nbsp;He sent upon them his burning anger,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wrath and indignation and distress,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a band of destroying angels.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>50</sup>&nbsp;He cleared a path for his anger;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he did not spare them from death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but gave their lives over to the plague.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>51</sup>&nbsp;He struck all the firstborn in Egypt,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the first fruits of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>52</sup>&nbsp;Then he led out his people like sheep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>53</sup>&nbsp;He led them in safety, so that they were not afraid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>54</sup>&nbsp;And he brought them to his holy territory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the mountain which his right hand had acquired.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>55</sup>&nbsp;He drove out nations before them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and allotted them an inheritance by lot<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made the tribes of Israel dwell in their tents.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>56</sup>&nbsp;Yet they tested and rebelled against the Most High God<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not keep his testimonies,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>57</sup>&nbsp;but turned back and acted treacherously like their fathers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they twisted like a deceitful bow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>58</sup>&nbsp;For they provoked him to anger with their high places<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and moved him to jealousy with their idols.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>59</sup>&nbsp;God heard and was full of wrath,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he utterly rejected Israel.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>60</sup>&nbsp;He abandoned the dwelling at Shiloh,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the tent where he had dwelled among men,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>61</sup>&nbsp;and he gave his strength into captivity<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and his glory into the hand of the foe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>62</sup>&nbsp;He gave his people over to the sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and was furious with his inheritance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>63</sup>&nbsp;Fire devoured their young men,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their maidens had no marriage song.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>64</sup>&nbsp;Their priests fell by the sword,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their widows made no lamentation.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>65</sup>&nbsp;Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a warrior shouting because of wine.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>66</sup>&nbsp;And he struck his enemies back;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he put them to everlasting shame.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>67</sup>&nbsp;He rejected the tent of Joseph;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>68</sup>&nbsp;but he chose the tribe of Judah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mount Zion, which he loved.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>69</sup>&nbsp;He built his sanctuary like the heights,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the earth which he has established forever.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>70</sup>&nbsp;He chose David his servant<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and took him from the sheepfolds;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>71</sup>&nbsp;from tending the ewes that nurse<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he brought him to shepherd Jacob his people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Israel his inheritance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>72</sup>&nbsp;So he shepherded them according to the integrity of his heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and guided them with skillful hands.<br></p>

    <h2>Chapter 79</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;But my people did not listen to my voice;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Israel would not submit to me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;So I gave them over to the stubbornness of their heart,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Oh that my people would listen to me,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;You will arise and have compassion on Zion;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for it is the time to show favor to her;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the appointed time has come.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;For Your servants hold her stones dear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have pity on her dust.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;The nations will fear the name of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and all the kings of the earth Your glory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;For the LORD builds up Zion;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He appears in His glory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;He regards the prayer of the destitute<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and does not despise their prayer.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Let this be written for a generation to come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that a people yet to be created may praise the LORD,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;that He looked down from His holy height,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from heaven the LORD looked at the earth,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;to hear the groaning of the prisoner,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to set free those doomed to die,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;that they may declare in Zion the name of the LORD,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in Jerusalem His praise,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;when peoples gather together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;He has broken my strength in midcourse;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has shortened my days.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;I say, “O my God,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do not take me away in the midst of my days—<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your years endure throughout all generations.”<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Of old You laid the foundation of the earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the heavens are the work of Your hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;They will perish, but You remain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they will all wear out like a garment.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will change them like a robe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they will pass away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;But You are the same,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Your years have no end.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;The children of Your servants shall dwell secure;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their offspring shall be established before You.<br></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are clothed with splendor and majesty,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;covering Yourself with light as with a garment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stretching out the heavens like a tent.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He makes the clouds His chariot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rides on the wings of the wind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;He makes His messengers winds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ministers a flaming fire.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;He set the earth on its foundations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that it should never be moved.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;You covered it with the deep as with a garment;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the waters stood above the mountains.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;At Your rebuke they fled;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the sound of Your thunder they took to flight.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;The mountains rose, the valleys sank down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the place that You appointed for them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;You set a boundary that they may not pass,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;You make springs gush forth in the valleys;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the cliffs are a refuge for the rock badgers.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;He made the moon to mark the seasons;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the word that He commanded, for a thousand generations,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;the covenant that He made with Abraham,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sworn promise to Isaac,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;which He confirmed to Jacob as a statute,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to Israel as an everlasting covenant,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as your portion for an inheritance.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;When they were few in number,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of little account, and sojourners in it,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;wandering from nation to nation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from one kingdom to another people,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;He allowed no man to oppress them;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rebuked kings on their account,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;saying, “Do not touch My anointed ones,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do My prophets no harm.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;When He summoned a famine on the land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and broke all supply of bread,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;He had sent a man ahead of them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph, who was sold as a slave.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;His feet were hurt with fetters;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his neck was put in a collar of iron;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;until what he had said came to pass,<br>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;The king sent and released him;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ruler of the peoples set him free;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;he made him lord of his house<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ruler of all his possessions,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;to bind his princes at his pleasure<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to teach his elders wisdom.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Then Israel came to Egypt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;And the LORD made His people very fruitful<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and made them stronger than their foes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;He turned their hearts to hate His people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deal craftily with His servants.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;He sent Moses His servant,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Aaron, whom He had chosen.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;They performed His signs among them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and miracles in the land of Ham.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;He sent darkness, and made the land dark;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they did not rebel against His words.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;He turned their waters into blood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and caused their fish to die.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;Their land swarmed with frogs,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even in the chambers of their kings.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;He spoke, and there came swarms of flies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and gnats throughout their land.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;He gave them hail for rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fiery bolts in their land.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;He struck down their vines and fig trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and shattered the trees of their territory.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;He spoke, and the locusts came,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young locusts without number,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;which devoured all the vegetation in their land<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and ate up the fruit of their ground.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;He struck down all the firstborn in their land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the firstfruits of all their strength.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;Then He brought out Israel with silver and gold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and there was none among His tribes who stumbled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;Egypt was glad when they departed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for dread of them had fallen upon them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;He spread a cloud for a covering,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and fire to give light by night.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;They asked, and He brought quail,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He gave them bread from heaven in abundance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;He opened the rock, and water gushed out;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it flowed through the desert like a river.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;For He remembered His holy promise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Abraham His servant.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;So He brought His people out with joy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His chosen ones with singing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>44</sup>&nbsp;And He gave them the lands of the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they inherited the fruit of the peoples’ labor,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>45</sup>&nbsp;that they might keep His statutes<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may rejoice in the gladness of Your nation,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that I may glory with Your inheritance.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;We have sinned, both we and our fathers;<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and put God to the test in the desert.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;He gave them what they asked,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but sent a wasting disease among them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;When men in the camp were jealous of Moses<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the flame burned up the wicked.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;They made a calf in Horeb<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had not Moses, His chosen one,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stood in the breach before Him,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to turn away His wrath from destroying them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Then they despised the pleasant land,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having no faith in His promise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;They murmured in their tents,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and did not obey the voice of the LORD.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Therefore He lifted His hand<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and swore to them<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that He would make them fall in the wilderness,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;and would make their offspring fall among the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scattering them among the lands.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Then they yoked themselves to Baal of Peor,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the plague was stayed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;And that was counted to him as righteousness<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from generation to generation forever.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;They angered Him at the waters of Meribah,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and it went ill with Moses on their account,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;for they made his spirit bitter,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and he spoke rashly with his lips.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>34</sup>&nbsp;They did not destroy the peoples,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as the LORD commanded them,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>35</sup>&nbsp;but they mixed with the nations<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and learned to do as they did.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>36</sup>&nbsp;They served their idols,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which became a snare to them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>37</sup>&nbsp;They sacrificed their sons<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and their daughters to the demons;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>38</sup>&nbsp;they poured out innocent blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blood of their sons and daughters,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the land was polluted with blood.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>39</sup>&nbsp;Thus they became unclean by their acts,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and played the whore in their deeds.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>40</sup>&nbsp;Then the anger of the LORD was kindled against His people,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and He abhorred His inheritance.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>41</sup>&nbsp;He gave them into the hand of the nations,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so that those who hated them ruled over them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>42</sup>&nbsp;Their enemies oppressed them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and they were brought into subjection under their power.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>43</sup>&nbsp;Many times He delivered them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but they were rebellious in their purposes<br>
