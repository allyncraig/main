    <h1>The Epistle of Paul to the Ephesians</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to the saints who are in Ephesus and faithful in Christ Jesus:</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;just as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless before him in love.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;He predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he has graciously given us in the Beloved One.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of trespasses, according to the riches of his grace&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;which he lavished on us in all wisdom and understanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;He made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in him&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring together all things in Christ—things in heaven and things on earth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;In him we also were appointed, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;so that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise of his glory.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;In him you also, when you heard the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the possession, to the praise of his glory.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Because of this, I too, having heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance among the saints,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;and what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;He exercised this power in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;far above every rule and authority and power and dominion, and every name that is named—not only in this age but also in the one to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;He put all things in subjection under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;And you were dead in your transgressions and sins,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the ruler of the power of the air—the spirit now at work in the sons of disobedience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Among them we all once lived in the desires of our flesh, carrying out the inclinations of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;even when we were dead in transgressions, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;and raised us up with Him and seated us with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;so that in the coming ages He might show the immeasurable riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves—it is the gift of God;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;not from works, so that no man may boast.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand so that we might walk in them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Therefore remember that formerly you—the Gentiles in the flesh, called “uncircumcision” by those called “circumcision” (a circumcision made in the flesh by human hands)—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;were at that time without Christ, alienated from the citizenship of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups one and tore down the dividing wall of hostility,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;by abolishing in His flesh the law of commandments in ordinances, so that He might create in Himself one new man in place of the two, making peace,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;and might reconcile both to God in one body through the cross, by which He put the hostility to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And He came and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;for through Him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;So then, you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;in whom the whole building, being joined together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;In Him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;assuming you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;that by revelation the mystery was made known to me, just as I wrote above in brief.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;When you read this, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;This mystery was not made known to the sons of men in previous generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Of this gospel I became a servant according to the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the working of His power.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given—to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;and to bring to light for all what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God, who created all things,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;so that now, through the church, the multifaceted wisdom of God might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;This was according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through faith in Him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Therefore I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;I pray that, according to the riches of His glory, He would grant you to be strengthened with power through His Spirit in your inner being,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being rooted and grounded in love,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;may have strength to grasp, along with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than all we ask or think, according to the power at work within us,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 4</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;I, therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling with which you were called,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were also called in one hope of your calling—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;one Lord, one faith, one baptism,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Therefore it says, “When He ascended on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;(Now what does “He ascended” mean except that He also descended into the lower regions, the earth?&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;He who descended is the same one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that He might fill all things.)</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;And He Himself gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, some as pastors and teachers,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;so that we may no longer be children, tossed back and forth by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human trickery, or craftiness in deceitful schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;But speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;from whom the whole body, being joined and held together by every joint that supplies, according to the proper working of each individual part, causes the growth of the body for building itself up in love.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;So I say this and testify in the Lord: you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their philosophies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to the hardness of their hearts.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;Having become callous, they have given themselves over to sensuality for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;But that is not how you learned Christ—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;if indeed you heard Him and were taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;that you are to put off, with regard to your former way of life, the old man, which is being corrupted by the deceitful desires,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;and to be renewed in the spirit of your mind,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;and to put on the new man, created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;and do not give the devil an opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him work, performing useful labor with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with those in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;Let no corrupt word come out of your mouth, but only what is good for building up, as fits the occasion, so that it may give grace to those who hear.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and shouting and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, just as God in Christ also forgave you.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, be imitators of God, as beloved children,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and walk in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave Himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a pleasing aroma.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;But sexual immorality and any kind of impurity or greed must not even be mentioned among you, as is proper for saints.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk, or crude joking—which are out of place—but rather thanksgiving.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;For you can be sure of this: that no sexually immoral or impure man, or one who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, do not be partners with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;trying to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Do not participate in the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For it is shameful even to speak of the things they do in secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;But everything exposed by the light becomes visible,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;for what makes everything visible is light. Therefore it says, “Awake, O sleeper, and rise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.”</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Be very careful, then, how you walk—not foolishly, but wisely,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;making the most of the time, because the days are evil.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;speaking to one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your heart to the Lord,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;always giving thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as to the Lord.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ also is the head of the church—He Himself being the Savior of the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>25</sup>&nbsp;Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>26</sup>&nbsp;to sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water with the word,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>27</sup>&nbsp;so that He might present the church to Himself in splendor, without stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and blameless.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>28</sup>&nbsp;In the same way, husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>29</sup>&nbsp;For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does the church,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>30</sup>&nbsp;because we are members of His body.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>31</sup>&nbsp;For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>32</sup>&nbsp;This mystery is great, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>33</sup>&nbsp;Nevertheless, each one of you must also love his own wife as himself, and the wife must respect her husband.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 6</h2>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;“Honor your father and mother”—this is the first commandment with a promise:&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;“so that it may go well with you and that you may live long on the earth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with sincerity of heart, as you would Christ—&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;not only when they are watching, as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Serve with goodwill as to the Lord and not to men,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;knowing that whatever good each one does, he will receive back from the Lord, whether slave or free.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>&nbsp;And masters, do the same to them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no partiality with him.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>10</sup>&nbsp;Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;Put on the full armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>12</sup>&nbsp;For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against authorities, against the worldly rulers of this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>13</sup>&nbsp;Therefore, take up the full armor of God, so that you may be able to resist when evil comes and, having done everything, to stand firm.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Stand, then, having fastened the belt of truth around your waist and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;and having fitted your feet with the readiness of the gospel of peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>16</sup>&nbsp;In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>18</sup>&nbsp;Pray in the Spirit at all times with every kind of prayer and petition. To this end, stay alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>19</sup>&nbsp;And pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, a word may be given to me so that I will boldly make known the mystery of the gospel,&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>20</sup>&nbsp;for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>21</sup>&nbsp;Now so that you also may know how I am doing and what I am up to, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will tell you everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;I have sent him to you for this very reason, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;Peace to the brothers, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>24</sup>&nbsp;Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.</p>
