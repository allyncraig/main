# Aramaic Primacy - The Original Language(s) of the New Testament

## Introduction

To me it is very clear from all of the available evidence that Peshitta is absolutely not the original NT text. I also see strong evidence that a significant portion of NT was written in Greek, thus I also reject Aramaic Primacy of the entire NT with reference to an earlier, pre-Peshitta Aramaic text.

A strong linguistically-based argument was made by Drew Longacre in his article [“Was the New Testament Written in Hebrew, Aramaic, or Greek?”](https://www.logos.com/grow/min-was-the-new-testament-written-in-hebrew-aramaic-or-greek/) Rather than repeat his arguments, I refer you to his article, especially in the *Language Evidence for Greek* section and following.

But, is it possible that at least parts of the NT were written in a language other than Greek? If so, which books, and in what languages were they originally written? Of all of the evidence that I have reviewed, I think that there are only two books of the NT for which a possible (but inconclusive) argument might be made for non-Greek Primacy.

## **The Gospel of Matthew**

There is an interesting quote from Papias, a 2nd Century church father: “Matthew put together the sayings \[of the Lord\] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.” Some have taken this comment to mean that Matthew’s gospel could originally have been written in Aramaic.

However, Papias only mentioned a collection of sayings by Matthew, and not the entire Gospel. Considering that Papias was known for oral traditions of sayings attributed to Christ, it is quite possible that Papias wasn’t talking about Matthew’s Gospel at all, but rather to a document by Matthew containing a collection of quotes by Jesus and which has not survived to our times.

Another problem is that Papias used the word “Hebrew”, not “Syriac”. While some suggest that the word “Hebrew” meant “the language of the Jews”, and could have referred to either Hebrew or Aramaic, there is no evidence for such a suggestion in any extant writings. All writings from the time period clearly differentiate “Hebrew” from “Syriac”. So if Papias is suggesting that Matthew’s gospel were written in a language other than Greek, his suggestion omits Aramaic. Given that Hebrew was spoken during the 1st Century and widely understood within the Jewish Diaspora (see [The Languages of First Century Palestine](AramaicPrimacy-TheLanguagesOfFirstCenturyPalestine.md) for a discussion of the presence of Hebrew during that time), this is a valid possibility.

We don’t know the exact meaning of Papias’ comment, and given that several of his contemporaries reviled Papias for being a heretic, we can’t be sure what his quote proves, if anything. What we do know is that Matthew wrote his gospel with Jews in mind as his intended audience. We also know that at the time, the Jews widely spoke Greek and Hebrew, with many Jews in the east also speaking Aramaic. The only thing we can say with certainty is that Papias does not suggest that the Gospel of Matthew was originally written in Aramaic.

## **The Epistle to the Hebrews**

Like Matthew, it is widely recognized that the Epistle to the Hebrews was specifically written to Jewish Christians and as such is not a “General Epistle”. The fact that it contains numerous references to the Jewish priesthood and other topics which would have been familiar to Jews, makes it clear that the audience had to have been Jews, and this has led some to speculate that Aramaic was its original language.

However, there are some problems with this conclusion. The most obvious being that a primarily Jewish audience does not presuppose an Aramaic original text, especially since Jews west of Palestine had very little knowledge of Aramaic. Also, the text of the book suggests that the audience was living in one city or region, but the location of this city is not given, so it cannot be said with any degree of certainty what language(s) was spoken in that area. The only language we can reasonably suggest that the audience would have known is Hebrew.

This does not imply that the Epistle was written in Hebrew, nor does it exclude Greek or Aramaic.

What we do see is that the text of the epistle is “written at such a high level of literary Greek that no serious linguistic case can be made that it is a translation from a Semitic original. The book may have been written primarily to Greek-speaking Jews (‘the Hebrews’), but it was almost certainly not composed in the Hebrew language.” See [Drew Longacre's Article](https://www.logos.com/grow/min-was-the-new-testament-written-in-hebrew-aramaic-or-greek/\#:\~:text=The%20fact%20that%20even%20the,books%20of%20the%20New%20Testament)

Given the lack of any specific evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to conclude that the Epistle to the Hebrews was originally written in Greek. Indeed, the biggest dispute among biblical researchers regarding this epistle is not its original language, but the identity of its author and whether Paul actually wrote it.
